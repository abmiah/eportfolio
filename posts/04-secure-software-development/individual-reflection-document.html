            <article>
                <p><b>1.	Introduction </b></p>
                <p>The Secure Software Development module, a pivotal part of my academic journey, was instructed by Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis. It encompassed six units and four assignments, each contributing significantly to my understanding and application of secure software development principles. These assignments included a group project with peer review, an individual coding project derived from the group assignment, and a short reflective piece.</p>
                <p>There were also several formative activities, one of which was our usual forum discussion on UML flowchart, which most of my peers participated in. The other activities comprised self-assessed or coding exercises.</p>
                <p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn from Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis, even though I was unable to attend all four of his seminars due to scheduling conflicts with my full-time job as a digital designer for a SaaS company. However, I made sure to watch the recordings once they were made available. I regret not being able to participate live, as the seminars were highly engaging, and I had pertinent questions to pose. Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis's dedication and profound grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) have been instrumental in my learning journey.</p>
                <p><b>2.	Main Assignment</b></p>
                <p>Due to the word limit of this reflection piece, one will only focus on the primary assignment, which took precisely three weeks to complete. Upon submission of the group report, I commenced work on the culminating assignment. This task necessitated the creation of a database using the UML class diagram and OOP coding, as outlined in the project brief. Despite my prior exposure to databases in the inaugural module <b>Launching into Cybersecurity</b>, I recognised the need to revisit past coursework and exercises to reinvigorate one understanding. I discerned that my proficiency in SQL database creation was somewhat constrained in fulfilling the requisites of the assignment. However, after conducting extensive research and carefully reviewing various articles and resources, I encountered a Python library known as SQLite3, which was later covered in one of the seminars. SQLite is the database engine that enables the storage of databases in a single file, facilitating easy copying and sharing. This library appears to be well-suited for fulfilling the project's requirements.</p>
                <p>Despite the straightforward nature of the YouTube tutorials, I followed to set up SQLite, I encountered multiple errors. These challenges, including improper dataset configurations and missing commas, required me to convert datatime into string format. However, I persevered and ultimately succeeded, which was a deeply satisfying achievement.</p>
                <p>While I have had some prior exposure to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it is not my strong suit. Consequently, I found it necessary to review tutorials from previous modules, as well as resources from Codecademy and YouTube, to attain sufficient comfort to commence coding. The use of the UML structure proved to be particularly beneficial in guiding the declaration of appropriate classes and methods.</p>
                <p><b>3.	Further Learning:</b></p>
                <p>My commitment to learning extends far beyond this course. Fuelled by an unyielding quest for information, I am determined to deepen my understanding of the topics covered here to enhance my professional development. I have already identified a specific area of interest that I am eager to explore further, which will undoubtedly contribute to my personal growth.</p>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Further understanding of OOP in Python and considering coding in C. Although C is best suited for OOP, it has a complex learning curve and can be confusing.</li>
                        <li>SQL with Python and understand better approaches. Utilise CRUD methodology with the use of frameworks such as Flask or Django, which will require deeper learning of these.</li>
                        <li>Explore more security tools and coding best practices.</li>
                    </ul>
