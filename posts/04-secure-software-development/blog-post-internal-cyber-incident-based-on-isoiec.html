            <article>
                <p> The International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) (CSRC, n.d.) provides a wealth of guidance and standards for organisations to enhance their security practices through their information security management system (ISMS). This framework equips organisations to actively manage potential security risks and maintain a proactive approach towards their information security (ISO, 2022). The ISO offers detailed documentation that outlines best practices for information security management (ISO, 2019).</p>
                <p> The third section of the document, <b>‘3 Terms and Definitions,’</b> furnishes a comprehensive list of 77 terms upon which the authorisation of complete document purchases can offer a complete definition. The section serves as a thorough exposition of the ISO requirements that organisations should comply with. The following five terms organisations can follow to prevent internal attacks are as follows.</p>
                <p><b>3.1 - Access Control</b><br> Organisations must ensure that access to assets via their systems, such as company logs and data files, is authorised and restricted based on business and security needs. For example, marketing employees should not have access to human resources or financial records.</p>
                <p><b>3.5 – Authentication</b><br> Implementing this mechanism ensures that the individual accessing the systems or files is duly authorised, preventing unauthorised personnel from gaining access.</p>
                <p><b>3.14 – Control </b><br> Establish controls that can help reduce potential risks. These controls may pertain to implementing processes or devices, including but not limited to computers, which can be instrumental in mitigating unwanted consequences. </p>
                <p><b>3.41 – Management System </b><br> The organisation could utilise the management system to address policies and processes.</p>
                <p><b>3.46 – Monitoring </b><br> Checking systems and processes is a crucial aspect of ascertaining their operational status regarding any potential critical event. </p>
                <p> Additional definitions are available in ISO documentation, but the above points are fundamental commands for preventing possible internal cyber security incidents. Organisations must assess the risks associated with their structure and provide adequate monitoring for their security structure.</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your insightful overview of the Industrial Revolution and its transition to the current era of Industry 4.0. Indeed AI, machine learning and other digital technologies have played a transformative role in the industry 4.0 which raised risks as highlighted by (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019).</p>
                    <p>For example, competence risks and the need of new skills and competencies in industry 4.0; Kazançoglu and Özkan Özen (2018) argue that it will be vital to establish new criteria to hire and evaluate the human workforce. Moreover, Hecklau et al (2016) highlight the scarcity of qualified workers to meet the industry 4.0 challenges, which makes it a critical factor in the process of adjusting businesses to the industry 4.0 landscape, thus executives and recruiters now seek innovative behavior, critical thinking, knowledge and adaptation to technology during the recruitment and screening of applicants during the hiring processes.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I agree with your comment regarding the danger of cyber threats and cybercriminals exploiting potential system vulnerabilities in the context of new evolving technologies. The technological advancements and associated risks in the realm of Industry 4.0 really provides a thought-provoking perspective on the intricate interplay between innovation and security. Hence, it would be important to have proactive risk management strategies in place for businesses to survive in this rapidly changing landscape.</p>

                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    <p>This is a very interesting post and I have enjoyed your time loop use of providing a historical outlook on industry revolutions and where we are today, highlighting how far we have come. From steam power and manual labor, to artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced data analytics and IoT.</p>
                    <p>In today’s world, technology plays a crucial role in the smooth and continuous flow of information and communication, which is essential for the success of any business. The evolution and constant improvement of technology have brought about the industry 4.0 revolution, which has transformed various sectors, including technology, industries, and infrastructure. This has also brought in new risk types and how we address them.</p>
                    <p>Kovaite and Stankeviciene (2019) have identified 5 categories of risk, Technical, Competence, Behavioral, Data Security and Financial. Your use of examples highlights these perfectly. It also reminded me of the Knight Capital Group $440 million Software error. Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading, gaining the reputation of being one of the largest traders in US equities. It took 17 years of dedicated work to build Knight Capital Group into one of the leading trading houses on Wall Street. And it all nearly ended in less than one hour. At Knight, some new trading software contained a flaw that became apparent only after the software was activated when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opened that day. The errant software sent Knight on a buying spree, snapping up 150 different stocks at a total cost of around $7 billion, all in the first hour of trading. Knight attempted to cancel some of the purchases, however some stood confirmed, resulting in the massive blow to the company. (Alqudhaibi, Albarrak, Aloseel, Jagtap & Salonitis, 2023) This highlights another important example of technical risk.</p>
