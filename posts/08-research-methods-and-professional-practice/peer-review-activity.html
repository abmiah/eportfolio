                <p>For this peer review activity, participants must locate two papers within the computing field, concentrating on topics such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, or data science, as well as broader themes. The goal is to analyse the research methodologies employed in each study to fulfil their respective research objectives or aims.</p>
                <p>The two papers I will be reviewing are by Subramaniam et al. (2025), titled <b>“Enhanced Cybersecurity and Cyber-Attack Detection in Smart DC Microgrids Using Blockchain Technology and SVM Technique.”</b> And Maraveas et al. (2024), titled <b>“Cybersecurity Threats and Mitigation Measures in Agriculture 4.0 and 5.0,”</b></p>
                <h3>Enhanced Cybersecurity and Cyber-Attack Detection in Smart DC Microgrids Using Blockchain Technology and SVM Technique</h3>
                <p>The study conducted by Subramaniam et al. (2025) investigates the key components necessary for establishing a robust cybersecurity framework. It leverages the strengths of blockchain technology in data security alongside the classification capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to enhance cyber-attack detection in smart DC microgrids.</p>
                <p>Smart DC microgrids offer significant efficiency benefits but are also susceptible to cyber threats due to their reliance on communication networks. One proposed solution is a hybrid cybersecurity framework that integrates blockchain technology with machine learning, particularly utilising Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. Blockchain provides secure and transparent data transactions, while SVM is employed to detect anomalies that may signal potential cyberattacks. This combination enhances detection accuracy and strengthens resilience against cyber threats, reinforcing the integrity of smart DC microgrids and ensuring reliable operations in the face of evolving risks.</p>
                <p>The authors utilise appropriate and innovative methods to achieve their objectives. They adopt a comprehensive approach to smart grid security, integrating adversarial testing, quantum machine learning, and blockchain enhancements. The experimental results showcase the effectiveness of these methods in improving detection rates and mitigating privacy risks. However, challenges related to scalability and the evolving nature of threats underscore the need for further research.</p>
                <p>The paper adopts a method tailored to its objectives, leveraging advanced data collection techniques (such as Hardware-in-the-Loop and adversarial datasets) and sophisticated analysis methods (including quantum ensembles and blockchain) to bolster smart grid security. Although scalability and the evolution of threats present ongoing challenges, this hybrid approach demonstrates both innovation and effectiveness compared to traditional methods.</p>
                <p>The manuscript substantiates its assertions by comprehensively integrating theoretical frameworks, empirical evidence, and comparative analysis. It presents a robust and well-founded argument underpinning its conclusions.</p>

                <h3>Cybersecurity Threats and Mitigation Measures in Agriculture 4.0 and 5.0</h3>
                <p>In their second publication, Maraveas et al. (2024) investigate the recent advancements in cybersecurity for smart grids. They concentrate on integrating cutting-edge adversarial attack simulations with quantum machine learning and blockchain technology. This methodological approach aspires to bolster threat detection and enhance data security within these critical energy infrastructures.</p>
                <p>This paper investigates the cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in innovative grid systems, particularly in light of their susceptibility to sophisticated threats, such as black box attacks. It proposes a dual-faceted strategy that integrates deep black box adversarial attacks to uncover system weaknesses, alongside quantum voting ensemble models designed to enhance the precision of cyber-attack detection mechanisms. To strengthen data privacy, the proposed framework employs blockchain technology coupled with quantum-resistant encryption, ensuring the secure and decentralised storage of sensitive information. The proposed methodology is rigorously validated through experiments conducted on hardware-in-the-loop testbeds, achieving a detection accuracy of 93.9%, surpassing the performance of conventional techniques. In conclusion, this research delineates a comprehensive approach to augmenting the security and resilience of smart grid infrastructures in the face of evolving cyber threats.</p>
                <p>The amalgamation of research methodologies encompassing adversarial attack simulation, quantum-enhanced detection, and blockchain privacy mechanisms coherently aligns with the stipulated objectives articulated in the scholarly paper. This multifaceted approach is robustly justified, demonstrates innovation, and is substantiated by empirical evidence, rendering it suitably applicable to the articulated research inquiry.</p>
                <p>The methodologies employed in data collection align rigorously with the research objectives, offering comprehensive, realistic, and technically advanced approaches to addressing cybersecurity challenges in smart grids.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this study substantiates its findings through well-articulated arguments, robust methodological approaches, and empirical evidence, demonstrating the efficacy and advantages of the proposed cybersecurity framework for smart grids.</p>
