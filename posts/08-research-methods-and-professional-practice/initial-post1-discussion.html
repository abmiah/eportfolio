                <p>This case study investigates the ethical implications of Rogue Web Services. This web hosting company promotes its services under the tagline “Cheap, guaranteed uptime, no matter what” (Association for Computing Machinery, 2024). This marketing strategy has drawn clients with potentially malicious intentions who exploit the hosting services to disseminate malware and spam. </p>
                <p>This situation raises several concerns regarding the ethical dimensions of the company’s operations. Notably, the company has shown a blatant disregard for its responsibility by refusing to engage with ISPs despite being aware that their services were being used for illicit activities. Their inflexible stance of “no matter what” towards their customer base further underscores their lack of responsibility. According to Roguewebhosting.com (2025), the company asserts on its recently updated website that it offers solutions tailored for businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>According to the Association for Computing Machinery (2024), the company violated several ethical standards and principles of professional conduct, one of which is to avoid causing harm. Furthermore, the Association for Computing Machinery (2018) specifies in section 1.2 that no damage should be inflicted on property and that information should not be disclosed, nor should there be any physical or mental harm. This statement aligns with BCS (2022), which, in their public interest guidelines, section 1, states the need to consider the health of the public, including their security and privacy, all of which Rogue Services failed to uphold; this is also supported by w3.org (2024), who states that the web should not cause any harm especially those who are deemed vulnerable. </p>
                <p>Addressing cybercrime, as well as the individuals and entities that promote it through various services, presents significant challenges due to the diverse jurisdictional regulations that govern the companies involved. These complexities stem from national laws, which can be intricate and often lead to conflicts with the prevailing legal frameworks within specific regions.</p>
