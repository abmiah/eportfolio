                <p><b>1. Introduction:</b> <span class="word-count-red">{slide 01}</span></p>
                <p>Hi there, my name is Amrol Miah. I am pursuing my MCs in Cyber security, Research Methods, and Professional Practice, which is our 9th module. For unit 10 of this program, I will discuss <b>Cyberbullying: how serious is it, what impact does it have, and what are the current laws in the UK?</b></p>

                <p><b>2. What is bullying?</b> <span class="word-count-red">{slide 02}</span></p>
                <p>The term <b>"bully”</b>, according to Harper (2019), can be traced back to the 1530s, when it was initially signified <b>"sweetheart."</b> Over time, the connotation of the term has significantly changed, evolving into a reference to a person who engages in harassment characterised by both physical and psychological abuse (Donegan, 2012).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 03}</span><br>
                    Before one can examine the notion of cyberbullying, it is imperative first to comprehend the underlying concept of bullying. According to Koh and Wong (2015), bullying has evolved through the framework of evolutionary psychology theory, also called EPT. This theory states that humans have developed specific behaviours to enhance survival and reproductive success. The theory of EPT suggests that bullying may have evolved as an adaptive behaviour that confers a competitive advantage in securing enhanced sexual opportunities, supplementing physical protection, and fostering improved mental health. This argument is supported by Volk et al. (2012), who stated that theories related to adolescent bullying can be beneficial or constructive in specific contexts rather than solely detrimental or harmful. This perspective is partly a response to prior evolutionary developments that have shaped typical traits and behaviours. This argument is further supported by Fritscher (2023), who states that the evolution of the human cognitive process, emotional traits towards others and behaviours have developed over time with the sole objective of reproducing and surviving.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 04}</span><br>
                    In today’s society, bullying has evolved beyond its primitive associations with basic human survival and reproductive behaviours. It has emerged as a pervasive issue among youth, a phenomenon first highlighted by Burk (1897, p.1) titled <b>"Teasing And Bullying."</b> In this publication, Burk delineates instances of young children’s interactions characterised by torment and harassment among peers. Koo (2008) states that bullying has historically been an inherent aspect of human interaction. However, while traditional bullying often manifests as physical aggression perpetrated by larger, visibly stronger children against their smaller, weaker peers, contemporary bullying has evolved to encompass both verbal harassment and psychological abuse.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 05}</span><br>
                    This presentation seeks to examine the issue of cyberbullying, which is defined by online verbal harassment and threats of abuse, which have escalated with the proliferation of social media platforms. Given that individuals are connected around the clock, it is imperative to understand the scope and implications of this issue. It is important to clarify that this presentation will not examine specific aspects of cyberbullying, such as child grooming, materials associated with pornography nature, racial hatred, or issues related to religious beliefs and sexual orientation. Rather, the objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of cyberbullying and its impact it has. The data mentioned in this presentation will indicate the global effects of cyberbullying; however, the discussion will primarily focus on the UK context regarding legislative measures to combat cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><b>3. The current state of Cyberbullying</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 06}</span></p>
                <p>According to Limber and Small (2003), bullying from young children and adolescents has increased, especially within the school environment, and this is more noticeable in American schools, which affect roughly 30% of school children; comparing this data from 2021 to 2022, 19.2% of bullying is carried out in schools with female as the main perpetrators of which only 16.7% were males (Statista Research Department, 2024). </p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 07}</span><br>
                    According to UNICEF (2019), one in three minors across 30 countries has experienced some form of online bullying victimisation. Additionally, one in five young children are absent from school due to cyberbullying and the apprehension of potential physical abuse, with the majority of these incidents being perpetrated through social media platforms; this is further supported by Zhu et al. (2021), who state that the accessibility of the internet, combined with the widespread popularity of social media, has contributed to an increase of cyberbullying. This assertion is further substantiated by Lacroix (2024), who states that inappropriate behaviours on social media platforms have facilitated the harassment of individuals, mainly through the capability of users to create multiple profiles and accounts.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 08}</span><br>
                    According to Dixon (2024b), the risk of experiencing cyberbullying varies across different countries. For instance, in South Africa, 36% of online users reported being likely to encounter cyberbullying. In comparison, both the United States and India recorded a prevalence of 29% of individuals facing some form of online harassment or abuse. In the United Kingdom and Denmark, 22% of users reported experiences of online abuse.</p>
                <p>{<span class="word-count-red">slide 09}</span><br>
                    Further analysis of the data regarding the susceptibility to cyberbullying by sex globally indicates that females are at an elevated risk compared to their male counterparts, with prevalence rates of 72% for females and 68% for males. Regarding exposure to misinformation or disinformation, the statistics show a relatively equivalent impact on both sexes, as evidenced by 53% of females and 51% of males reporting such experiences. Notably, however, a substantial disparity is observed concerning the risks associated with suicide and self-harm, with 19% of females and 13% of males reporting incidents in this domain (Dixon, 2024a).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 10}</span><br>
                    According to Dixon (2024d), there has been a notable increase in cyberbullying among young girls and women. For instance, in 2013, 40% of respondents reported receiving negative comments, which has escalated to 51% by 2023. Furthermore, the prevalence of young girls and women reporting receipt of photos or content deemed inappropriate or distressing has also seen a significant rise, from 17% in 2013 to 37% in 2023. Additional data indicates that 60% of young girls and women express concern regarding the effects of online abuse on their mental health, and an overwhelming 83% believe that more efforts should be directed towards addressing sexism and online abuse (Dixon, 2024c).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 11}</span><br>
                    Data from the UK indicates that a large number of children aged 10 to 15 have faced incidents of cyberbullying. The manifestations of cyberbullying are diverse; specifically, 18% of these children have reported experiencing general bullying behaviours, 10.5% have been subjected to name-calling or profanities, and 10.1% have encountered the spreading of rumours.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 12}</span><br>
                    A significant observation indicates that 92.6% of children engage in daily internet usage, with the highest activity levels occurring during weekends; 58.1% of children report spending over three hours online during this period. Furthermore, 86.6% of children access the internet via smartphones, while 54.7% utilise gaming consoles for connectivity (Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2020; Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2024).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 13}</span><br>
                    Subsequent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) (2020) reveals that approximately 72% of children who undergo online abuse have concurrently experienced bullying within the schooling environment. This suggests that offenders who target their victims persist in their harassment through online platforms. Given the extensive nature of social media, these perpetrators can effectively conceal their identities by operating from behind computer screens.</p>

                <p><b>4. Conventional bullying versus Cyberbullying</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 14}</span></p>
                <p>The advent of technology, which can be suggested as a significant enhancement to contemporary living, has positioned the internet as one of the most pivotal inventions of the 21st century. It has facilitated the emergence of social media platforms, chat rooms, email, and online communities, enabling global connectivity unprecedented in human history. Furthermore, the proliferation of innovative Internet of Things, IoT devices, including computers, tablets, smartwatches, and mobile phones, has transformed the dynamics of communication and interaction across vast geographical distances (Donegan, 2012; Felman, 2024). The important question arises: how is this related to bullying? </p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">slide 15}</span><br>
                    Traditionally, school bullying encompasses a range of psychological abuses, including the dissemination of false rumours, verbal insults, belittlement, name-calling, and threats of violence, as well as physical abuses such as pushing, shoving, spitting, and unwanted physical contact.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, it may involve soliciting others to participate in abusive behaviours (Anti-Bullying Alliance, 2022; Felman, 2024). According to Salmivalli et al. (1996), bullying manifests as a process occurring within a social group, wherein the victim finds themselves defenceless and possesses minimal or no capacity to evade their assailants. This dynamic is further perpetuated by the bully receiving support from other group members.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 16}</span><br>
                    The traditional form of bullying has now evolved into the digital realm of cyberbullying, which uses the same characteristics as conventional bullying; however, they do have differences; perpetrators hide behind computers, masking their identity with advanced users may even use a VPN, a Virtual Private Network, which is a software that hides users location by encrypting the IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, these IP addresses are unique addresses that identify devices via the internet. VPN will mask users’ IP addresses by redirecting users to another location. For example, a user from the United Kingdom can hide their IP address to make it seem they are located in the United States (Donegan, 2012; Kaspersky, 2021; PrivadoVPN, 2022).</p>

                <p><b>5. The impact of cyberbullying</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 17}</span></p>
                <p>According to Koo (2008), the consequences of bullying can result in significant emotional difficulties for victims, leading to conditions such as depression, anger, helplessness, fear, insomnia, and anxiety. This assertion is further corroborated by <b><em>(Ol-VAY-us)</em></b> Olweus (2012), who states that cyberbullying yields comparable adverse effects to traditional bullying, encompassing not only depression and anxiety but also suicidal ideation and various psychological disorders. Subsequent research has indicated that children who have experienced bullying may exhibit an increased tendency for psychotic behaviour by the time they reach 18 years of age. These individuals are more likely to experience suicidal ideations and often report poorer general health. Additionally, they tend to attain lower educational qualifications, which can lead to challenges in maintaining a stable career; this may, in part, be attributed to higher rates of school absence. Furthermore, victims of bullying are frequently identified as having difficulties in forming or sustaining friendships, with a tendency towards antisocial behaviour. As a result, such individuals may remain single longer or, more frequently, become young parents, necessitating social support services (Wolke and Lereya, 2019).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 18}</span><br>
                    According to YoungMinds (2025), research data indicate that 12.2% of online victims have accessed websites containing content related to suicidal tendencies, in contrast to 3.7% of individuals who have not experienced online abuse. Furthermore, the data suggest that 17.7% of those subjected to online abuse have also visited sites associated with self-harm, compared to 5.7% of individuals who have not encountered any form of cyberbullying. This statistic in isolation raises significant concerns; in instances of severe online harassment, it indicates that young children may be at an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.</p>

                <p><b>6. Cyberbullying Case studies</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 19}</span></p>
                <p>The case of Megan Evan, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, tragically ended with her suicide in 2017 following an extensive cyberbullying campaign titled <b>"I Hate Megan."</b> The school ultimately removed this campaign, yet another one encouraging her to <b>“kill herself"</b> persisted on various social media platforms. In the aftermath of this relentless harassment, Megan's behaviour at school became increasingly erratic; the previously well-behaved student exhibited frequent outbursts, which were not communicated to her parents (Rigg, 2024). </p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 19}</span><br>
                    However, according to <b><em>(Dav-i-th)</em></b> Dafydd (2024), an inquest into the circumstances surrounding Megan’s death determined that the coroner was unable to locate any evidence indicating that she was the target of abuse, either within the school environment or online. Nonetheless, the coroner acknowledged the inherent difficulties in identifying instances of abuse, both in school settings and in the digital realm. It was noted that expressions such as <b>“kill yourself”</b> were prevalent in online communications.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 20}</span><br>
                    It can be argued that the coroners are not medical experts and lack the specialised training required to understand psychological behaviours, such as those associated with bullying. Their primary responsibility as judicial officers are to determine the causes of death. To fulfil this duty, they conduct necessary inquiries, which include acquiring witness statements and reviewing medical records (Nidirect, 2015). As previously discussed, victims of cyberbullying often experience significant psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, in addition to other mental health disorders. This may provide insight into Megan’s behavioural disruptions in school.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 21}</span><br>
                    Furthermore, there was a lack of thorough investigation regarding Megan’s online interactions and the nature of the messages directed at her. It is essential to note the existence of a hate group established with the intent to humiliate Megan. Although the school acted promptly to disband this group, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether additional groups were formed to inflict psychological harm on Megan.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 22}</span><br>
                    The case of Mia Janin, who tragically took her own life at the age of 14 in 2021 as a result of cyberbullying, exemplifies the severe consequences of online harassment. Mia experienced bullying both in school and online. Her distress was exacerbated when her social media content was manipulated to portray a pornographic nature. Furthermore, it has been revealed that Mia was the third student from the Jewish Free School (JFS) to have died by suicide (Kuenssberg and Seddon, 2024; Lynn, 2023; Lynn and Low, 2023). This prompts an inquiry into whether educational institutions are either incapable or inadequately prepared to address the issue of cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><b>7. Legal Actions Against Cyberbullying</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 23}</span></p>
                <p>In the UK, there exists a significant lack of dedicated legislative measures specifically addressing bullying and cyberbullying. Rather, the regulation of these issues is reliant upon the implementation of extant legal frameworks that pertain to associated aspects of cyberbullying. These laws include the following: Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Malicious Communication Act 1988, Communication Act 2003, and Defamation Act 2013 (Anti-Bullying Alliance, 2024; Kuenssberg and Seddon, 2024).</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 24}</span><br>
                    The UK government has publicised the Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA), a regulatory framework to enhance internet users' safety within the UK. This legislation mandates that online platforms have a system to manage content deemed harmful or contravenes UK law. The new legislation established by Ofcom aims to create a criminal offence to enhance online safety regulations. This initiative seeks to provide improved protection for children, uphold the rights to freedom of expression, and promote transparency and accountability in utilising online services. The Act encompasses provisions addressing false or threatening communications, including the dissemination of flashing images which may pose risks to individuals susceptible to epilepsy, as well as the distribution of pornographic materials, such as images or films depicting genitalia. Additionally, it addresses the encouragement of self-harm and the sharing or threats to share intimate photographs or videos; this is also in relation to child sexual abuse (CPS, 2022; Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2024; UK Government, 2023).</p>

                <p><b>8. Conclusion</b><span class="word-count-red">{slide 25}</span></p>
                <p>Cyberbullying has become a significant sociocultural issue in today's society, largely due to the widespread nature of internet connectivity. The extensive reach of online communication has profoundly changed the landscape of harassment, particularly as social media platforms enable interactions among individuals of various age groups. It has been noted that when individuals face bullying in physical settings, aggressors often extend their harassment into the online space, increasing the psychological distress experienced by the victim.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 26}</span>
                    Further research is essential to clarify the underlying motivations of bullies, which may include factors such as educational backgrounds, previous experiences with bullying, family environments, and the possible influences of religious beliefs. This need is sadly illustrated by the tragic case of Mia Janin, who, despite attending a faith-based institution, tragically succumbed to the cumulative pressures from both school bullying and cyberbullying.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 27}</span><br>
                    The Online Safety Act 2023 represents a significant step forward in the UK's legislative efforts to combat online harassment. However, one might argue that the provisions outlined in the Act are considerably overdue, as identifying perpetrators remains extremely difficult, especially if these individuals use VPNs to mask their geographical locations. Moreover, the legislation is viewed as lacking clear guidelines for prosecuting juvenile offenders, resulting in significant flaws in its overall effectiveness.</p>
                <p><span class="word-count-red">{slide 28}</span><br>
                    Social media platforms are encouraged to strengthen their efforts against cyberbullying, collaborate more effectively with government agencies, and maintain transparency about their strategies and data related to online harassment.</p>
