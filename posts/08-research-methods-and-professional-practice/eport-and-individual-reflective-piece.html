                <h3>Part One: e-Portfolio artefacts review</h3>
                <p><b>1.	Introduction </b></p>
                <p>This module, Research Methods and Professional Practice, led by Karen Outram, consists of 12 units. Unlike previous modules that exclusively focused on specific study programs, such as MSc Cyber Security, this module welcomes students from various disciplines within the computing department. This interdisciplinary makeup has encouraged valuable insights into diverse cognitive approaches and methodologies among the student cohort.</p>
                <p>The module included three primary assignments, comprising this reflective piece and several formative activities that students were required to complete. In addition to these formative exercises, students were expected to participate in two collaborative discussions, which included a minimum of three peer responses and a summary from one initial post.</p>
                <p>This module greatly emphasised the importance of e-portfolios. For each assignment, students must update their e-portfolios to accurately reflect their course progress, outlining any learning.</p>
                <p>Given the constraints of this word count, one can only briefly describe only one unit artefact activity, which will include a links to my e-portfolio.</p>

                <p><b>2.	Unit 1 – Collaborative Discussion 1</b></p>
                <p>The first discussion, lasting three weeks, focused on a case study of Malware Disruption, analysing the ethical implications of Rogue Web Services. This hosting provider attracts clients who exploit its services for harmful purposes, such as distributing malware and spam. Their slogan reveals a troubling disregard for responsibility, avoiding interaction with ISPs despite being aware of illicit activities. Rogue Web Services breaches ethical standards concerning harm avoidance and public security. Jurisdictional differences complicate the fight against cybercrime. Organisations like these prioritise profit over ethics, fully aware of their clients' harmful activities.</p>

                <p>Another formative activity that one had to cover was Ethics in Computing, which reviewed Corrêa et al. (2023), analysing 200 AI ethics guidelines to establish a consensus on ethical principles for AI. Findings indicate a significant rise in AI investments, with U.S. firms receiving $90 billion in 2021. The study outlines 17 key ethical principles, such as accountability, human rights, and privacy. The authors stress the need for transparent regulatory frameworks and diverse perspectives in ethical discussions, noting limitations in linguistic scope and regional representation. Recent developments, including the EU’s AI Act, aim to regulate AI and address ethical risks. The EU Act's AI Opportunities Action Plan does not apply to the UK. The central theme highlights the importance of managing AI ethics for a positive societal impact.</p>

                <p><b>3.	Unit 2 - e-Portfolio Activity: Literature Review and Research Proposal Outline</b></p>
                <p>Utilising the template derived from the <b>“Literature Review Guide Questions,”</b> which includes nine inquiries designed to assist students in conducting their literature review, this resource systematically addresses the identification of the target audience, clarifies the significance of the evaluation, and outlines the expected content along with other crucial components. The primary objective is to streamline the literature review writing process for scholars. The guiding questions promote an unbiased approach for students undertaking a literature review, thereby enhancing objectivity in their analysis. This methodology encourages students to evaluate any discrepancies within the available research sources and recognise the limitations present in those studies.</p>

                <p><b>4.	Unit 3 - e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Activity</b></p>
                <p>This activity presents three questions for our research proposal: selecting a suitable methodology, identifying data collection methods, and outlining essential skills for successful project execution.</p>
                <p>My chosen literature review adopted a deductive quantitative methodology to investigate the <b>“Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in the Health Sector in the UK”</b> . It examines the financial repercussions of cyberattacks within the UK healthcare system, primarily utilising secondary data sources that reflect losses incurred, particularly concerning the NHS. The data sources will be carefully chosen from government publications, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The acquired data should assess how the appropriate measures were implemented to mitigate potential future exposure.</p>

                <p><b>5.	Unit 4 - Literature Review Outline Submission</b></p>
                <p>My outline was structured into three basic sections: an introduction, a research question, and a conclusion.</p>
                <p>The research will critically examine the historical impact of malware on operations within the NHS, with a particular emphasis on the financial ramifications experienced by the NHS and private sectors. Employing a deductive approach, the study evaluates trends in healthcare cyber threats in the UK, utilising credible data sources. Notable cyberattacks are identified, and mitigation strategies are assessed, comparing the responses of the NHS to those of the private sector. Limitations of the study include a reliance on the availability of existing reports and inherent challenges in quantifying the financial impacts of cyber incidents. The conclusion will likely highlight the necessity for independent analyses of cyberattacks, underscore the significance of lessons learned, and advocate for further research to pre-empt future incidents.</p>

                <p><b>6.	Unit 5 - Reflective Activity 2: Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Survey</b></p>
                <p>The case of Cambridge Analytica, a UK data consultancy scrutinised for collecting data from over 87 million Facebook users without consent through an app that misled users about its intended purpose, raised significant ethical, legal, and social issues regarding privacy violations and breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998. This data was used for psychographic profiling and targeted advertising, notably in the 2016 Trump and Brexit campaigns. The ICO raided Cambridge Analytica, seizing records and imposing penalties for data breaches. Facebook faced backlash and agreed to a $725 million settlement concerning the scandal, highlighting concerns about data privacy and corporate responsibility in protecting user information.</p>

                <p>There was no formative activity in Unit 6; instead, one focused on the literature review and the Unit 5 Wiki Activity: Questionnaire.</p>
                <p>The 2024 Ofsted questionnaire on children in social care received 43,777 responses, including 6,995 from children. This is an increase from 6,614 last year, despite the total dropping slightly.</p>
                <p>The questions address children's needs and well-being, aligning with the goals of the questionnaire. Future improvements will incorporate demographic factors such as age, nationality, gender, and caregiver locations to identify child populations in care and the regions of their caregivers.</p>

                <p><b>7.	Unit 7 - Collaborative Discussion 2: Case Study on Accuracy of Information</b></p>
                <p>The second discussion emphasised ethical considerations that lacked definitive answers. It centred on Abi, a researcher evaluating the nutritional claims of Whizzz cereal. Abi discovers inconsistencies that suggest health risks but also considers alternative narratives that could portray Whizzz positively. I emphasise the importance of ethical obligations in data collection, safeguarding reputations and fostering public trust. Ethical practices should ensure transparency and clarity to enhance reliability and accuracy. Abi's concerns about Whizzz's integrity highlight the necessity for honesty and integrity in professional roles. Prioritising public safety in data presentation is critical, as well as weighing risks against benefits to empower Whizzz in safeguarding health.</p>

                <p><b>8.	Unit 8 - e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Outline</b></p>
                <p>Students submit research proposals for 15-minute presentations requiring a transcript and Microsoft PowerPoint. I began with the research structure to assist in writing the proposal. A minimum of 1,500 words and a maximum of 2,250 words are necessary for a 15-minute presentation. I decided to focus on Cyberbullying instead of a literature review topic. The presentation is titled <b>“Cyberbullying, how serious is it, and what impact does it have in the UK?”</b></p>
                <p>This research explored the prevalence of cyberbullying on social media worldwide and observed emerging trends. It will discuss the implications for various countries, review UK laws regarding cyberbullying, and analyse cases of individuals who have been impacted by cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><b>9.	Unit 8 – Statistical Worksheet</b></p>
                <p>Our module tutor emphasised the importance of the statistical worksheet, which is mandatory for one e-portfolio. This included creating bar charts and histogram diagrams. In my example, I detailed each set of charts, analysing two datasets to determine which produced superior results. This analysis involved calculating several metrics, including the number of items and the minimum, maximum, and average values, along with complex statistical elements like upper-class boundaries (UCB), frequency, class mark, and relative frequency. These calculations were essential for constructing a histogram and comparing the two datasets to ascertain which performed better and draw a conclusion.</p>

                <p>For Unit 10, no formative assessment was listed; however, during that week, one had to submit the Research Proposal Presentation, which focused on Cyberbullying, and the Statistical Worksheet. Both assignments are available on my e-portfolio website, and each submission included a PowerPoint presentation of the research proposal, a transcript in both audio and Word documents and a video.</p>

                <p><b>10.	Unit 11 - e-Portfolio Preparation Seminar</b></p>
                <p>During the seminar, our module tutor provided an overview of preparing our e-portfolio and emphasised key tasks to be completed, showcasing our learning progress. One essential task involves creating a Skills Matrix, which helps students identify and improve individual competencies. This framework is instrumental in evaluating current skills and promotes the targeted enhancement of abilities crucial for academic and professional advancement. Developed systematically and offered by the University of Essex Online, this template is a valuable tool for assessing and categorising competencies within a defined context (University of Essex Online, 2025).</p>

                <h3>Part Two: Reflection</h3>

                <p><b>11.	Introduction</b></p>
                <p>Unlike other modules that focused exclusively on our core study concepts, particularly MSc Cyber Security in my case, I must admit that this module felt especially challenging and, in several ways, somewhat disorganised. This will be further discussed in the worksheet section. The module required not only the primary assignment, which is graded and includes a literature review, research presentation, and the current module's e-portfolio and reflection (this paper), but also several formative activities that, although not graded, were mandatory to support students in writing this paper. Managing all these assignments was occasionally challenging; what initially seemed like a part-time course has evolved into a full-time commitment. Balancing a full-time job and family responsibilities while striving to excel in all assignments became a difficult juggling act, as the course material was rich with valuable information and informative articles designed to enhance students' understanding of the module.</p>
                <p>In this reflection section, I will focus exclusively on the areas where I faced greater challenges compared to other units and those that provided valuable insights for my continued growth. Additionally, I will discuss my SWOT analysis and future action plan to enhance my development in cybersecurity.</p>

                <p><b>12.	 Worksheet </b></p>
                <p>I do not consider myself proficient in Excel and have only used the program for basic calculations and creating simple spreadsheets rather than for any advanced statistical analysis. However, students were required to complete several mandatory statistical worksheets; conversely, there was confusion about which exercise file to open on the hypothesis testing sheet. The document instructs us to open the file “Exa 8.4F.xlsx”; however, no file of that name exists. Instead, the file “Exa 7.4F.xlsx” was available on the worksheet download. I can only presume this was an oversight by the course administrators; Several of my peers expressed their confusion, which was frustrating since the formative aspect was a requirement that one would think would have been structured accordingly. It was also noted that several worksheets were missing, forcing us to move on to the next one.</p>
                <p>Another source of frustration was that, although it was not the course administrators' fault, the examples were shown using Excel, which was catered for Windows computers. Since I am using an Apple Mac, many instructions varied from the functions needed on Macs, requiring me to look up the Mac equivalents for Excel.</p>
                <p>Some concepts listed on the worksheet were not fully explained. For example, on the histogram worksheet, the upper-class boundaries (UCB) range was not adequately detailed, nor was the application of those sets of numbers. Additionally, the concept of “=TTEST” was not fully explained.</p>

                <p><b>13.	SWOT</b></p>
                <p>This SWOT analysis highlights my strengths and weaknesses (Dunne, 2022) and will adapt to McLeod’s (2024) What? So What? Now What? Methodology for learning growth. It expands on my Skill Matrix, identifying skill levels across categories.</p>

                <p><b>What?</b><br>
                This module has encountered various challenges, primarily due to unclear guidance within the units. The statistical component, essential for understanding, was disorganised, with some incomplete sections. Despite these issues, learning new deductive and inductive research methodology concepts has provided a strong foundation for future studies.</p>

                <p><b>So What?</b><br>
                Several academic researchers have used statistical analysis, especially the TTEST function in Excel, to compare data. I understand the benefits of fully grasping how to use this effectively in research but cramming it all into 12 weeks alongside the primary assignment would not be feasible. To enhance personal growth and professional academic research, one needs to explore this feature independently.</p>

                <p><b>Now What? </b><br>
                Based on my experience in statistical analysis, I believe that exploring a course in data analysis, both in Excel and Python, along with expanding one’s skill set in SQL, will enhance one’s knowledge and ability to utilise data management to advance one's career fully. I am not suggesting that one pursue a degree or master's course in data analysis, but rather that having a solid foundational working knowledge is useful within cybersecurity.</p>

                <p><b>14.	Further learning</b></p>
                <p>My commitment to learning extends beyond this course and hopefully into my professional career. I aim to deepen my understanding of the subject, particularly in statistical analysis. Additionally, I have identified a specific area of study that aligns with my aspirations for development.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advanced concept with Python OOP, SQL and general data analysis.</li>
                    <li>Explore Kali Linux for Network Security.</li>
                    <li>A better understanding of how to perform statistical analysis with Excel.</li>
                    <li>Read more literature on research and the latest trends within the industry.</li>
                    <li>Better time management.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>15.	Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>The outlook for cybersecurity professionals remains uncertain, as there have been many discussions about the threat of AI taking over various industries. For example, in web development, code can be generated with just a few lines of commands, and within seconds, one can create a functional website. Additionally, Trump's tariff policies and the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine contribute to significant uncertainty and ethical concerns globally.</p>
                <p>However, despite the gloomy perspective on global political issues, one must remain optimistic about the job market for cybersecurity professionals, as the threat landscape for cybercriminals will not cease; in fact, one could argue that threat actors might take advantage of and increase their stakes in unstable industries. According to Fleck (2024), global cybercrime is set to grow substantially, and predictions for 2028 suggest it could cost the global economy $13.82 trillion.</p>
                <p>As our daily lives become heavily reliant on technology, IoT devices, and digital platforms such as social media or e-commerce sites, the need for security measures to protect the general public from data theft and industries from losing significant amounts of money due to ransomware or data breaches must be addressed. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals should be considered an essential requirement for all sectors.</p>
