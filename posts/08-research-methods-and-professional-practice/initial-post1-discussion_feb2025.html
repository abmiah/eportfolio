                <p>This case study investigates the ethical implications of Rogue Web Services. This web hosting company promotes its services under the tagline “Cheap, guaranteed uptime, no matter what” (Association for Computing Machinery, 2024). This marketing strategy has drawn clients with potentially malicious intentions who exploit the hosting services to disseminate malware and spam. </p>
                <p>This situation raises several concerns regarding the ethical dimensions of the company’s operations. Notably, the company has shown a blatant disregard for its responsibility by refusing to engage with ISPs despite being aware that their services were being used for illicit activities. Their inflexible stance of “no matter what” towards their customer base further underscores their lack of responsibility. According to Roguewebhosting.com (2025), the company asserts on its recently updated website that it offers solutions tailored for businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>According to the Association for Computing Machinery (2024), the company violated several ethical standards and principles of professional conduct, one of which is to avoid causing harm. Furthermore, the Association for Computing Machinery (2018) specifies in section 1.2 that no damage should be inflicted on property and that information should not be disclosed, nor should there be any physical or mental harm. This statement aligns with BCS (2022), which, in their public interest guidelines, section 1, states the need to consider the health of the public, including their security and privacy, all of which Rogue Services failed to uphold; this is also supported by w3.org (2024), who states that the web should not cause any harm especially those who are deemed vulnerable. </p>
                <p>Addressing cybercrime, as well as the individuals and entities that promote it through various services, presents significant challenges due to the diverse jurisdictional regulations that govern the companies involved. These complexities stem from national laws, which can be intricate and often lead to conflicts with the prevailing legal frameworks within specific regions.</p>

                    <p><em>by Nima Osman - Tuesday, 4 February 2025, 5:42 PM</em></p>
                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your in-depth exploration of the ethical implications surrounding Rogue Web Services. You've highlighted key points, especially the company's failure to address its involvement in supporting illicit activities and their lack of responsibility regarding customer conduct. Your analysis of the ethical violations within the context of the ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct is well-articulated and certainly raises awareness of the broader consequences such actions can have on the digital ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>One area I’d like to add to your discussion is the concept of due diligence. Rogue Web Services' refusal to engage with ISPs when made aware of malicious activity could also be seen as a violation of responsibility under the ACM Code, specifically Principle 1.2, which calls for professionals to “avoid harm.” This lack of action could be seen as negligence, as the company had the responsibility to ensure their services were not being used for unethical purposes. However, an important critique to consider is the financial incentive that such hosting services often operate under. With such a “no questions asked” policy, they might attract customers who prioritize cheap services over ethical considerations. While this doesn't justify their actions, it's worth exploring how market pressures and demand for inexpensive services can contribute to such ethical lapses.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I think the complexity you touched on regarding jurisdictional regulations in dealing with cybercrime is crucial. Rogue Web Services might be operating in a way that maximises profit but avoids the scrutiny of specific legal frameworks in certain jurisdictions. This raises questions about the need for international cooperation in regulating companies operating globally. A uniform approach to managing digital ethics could make it more difficult for companies to exploit gaps in the law for malicious purposes.</p>
                    <p>Finally, while your post highlighted the company’s disregard for ethics, I wonder if there’s an opportunity for companies like Rogue Web Services to implement more ethical marketing strategies. For example, they could actively promote the importance of responsible internet usage and ethical business practices. This might even help protect their long-term viability, as businesses today are increasingly scrutinised for their corporate responsibility. Ethical companies can attract customers who value transparency, privacy, and security over purely economic considerations.</p>
                    <p>Overall, your post effectively showcases how such cases can escalate into larger ethical and legal issues, and it prompts us to think about how businesses in the tech industry must balance profitability with societal responsibility. Great work!</p>
                    <p>Best regards,</p>
                    <p>Nima</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your interesting post. Having picked the same topic, it was very interesting and informative to read a different perspective.</p>
                    <p>I believe Rogue Services raises several concerns regarding the ethical dimensions of the company’s operations. By advertising the “no matter what” tagline, they attracted clients who had less-than-honest intentions, to spread malware and spam. Notably, the company has shown a blatant disregard for its responsibility by refusing to engage with ISPs despite being aware that their services were being used for illicit activities, underscoring their lack of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Your post does a great job of pinpointing the ethical problems associated with Rogue Services. The Association for Computing Machinery (2024) highlights that the company violated key ethical standards by allowing its services to be used for harmful purposes, particularly by failing to prevent harm to others (ACM, 2024). You highlighted this well.</p>
                    <p>The complexities surrounding legal and jurisdictional challenges in addressing cybercrime has been highlighted to us previously, with EnrcoChat, ethics in computing with generative AI and this recent sample, Rogue Services. These challenges are further complicated by the global nature of the internet and varying legal frameworks. For example, the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) has established that domain registrars have a duty of care to disconnect domains used for illegal activities, such as copyright infringement. This decision underscores the responsibility of intermediaries in curbing harmful online practices, even when jurisdictional conflicts arise (Kluweriplaw.com, 2021). By ensuring that registrars take proactive measures, such as disconnection or freezing domains to prevent re-registration with other providers, this ruling illustrates how judicial systems can address the misuse of web services while navigating complex legal landscapes. Such approaches provide a framework for holding entities accountable across borders, although enforcement remains a challenge due to differing national laws.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Rogue Services exemplifies significant ethical shortcomings in its operations. By prioritizing profit over responsibility, the company has contributed to a detrimental environment for cybersecurity.</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for discussion post, I believe this is a highly relevant topic in the age of balancing user rights to privacy, “always-on” availability of paid services and ensuring a safe environment on the Internet. You have effectively highlighted the ethical concerns of the company, Rogue Web Services. Additionally, you have appropriately referenced ethical guidelines from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and British Computer Society (BCS), particularly focusing on harm, which Rogue Web Services seems to violate through its actions. To make the discussion more effective, I would conduct a more in-depth analysis of the specific harms caused by the clients of the hosting company. While you have briefly mentioned malware and spam, elaborating further on the type of harm caused upon individuals and organisations would have strengthened the argument. Another challenge which is more nuanced is what you have highlighted under the Public Interest guidelines from BCS, particularly on protecting the security and privacy of individuals. You could potentially argue that the “guaranteed uptime, no matter what” policy of the host upholds a critical GDPR requirement of availability, also a requirement under the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad (ICO, n.d.). This specifically requires that the users must always have access to their data, which is met by this policy. This also opens a wider discussion on platforms which are at risk of hosting potentially harmful content on their platforms for the sake of ensuring full privacy of their customers, and the balancing act in the light of the Online Safety Act as discussed by Clifford (2024). However, generally, under this use case, it is clear that the release of malware and spyware violates all other aspects of the triad, but interestingly, in real life, little action is taken by hosts to tackle this (Canali et al., 2013).</p>
                    <p>Thanks again for your contribution.</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for this informative post, your analysis highlights the ethical concerns associated with web hosting providers that facilitate illicit activities.</p>
                    <p>Rogue Web Services’ refusal to collaborate with ISPs demonstrates a lack of due diligence, which contradicts ethical computing principles. Additionally, your reference to jurisdictional complexities is crucial, as differing national laws create enforcement challenges (Gercke, 2021). Moreover, the marketing of these services raises ethical questions about responsibility and responsibility within the technological community. As Pacquet-Clouston et al. (2018), the responsibility for cybercrime cannot be singularly attributed to offenders; Companies that promote and facilitate these activities must also bear the weight of moral guilt. In this context, aggressive marketing tactics of Rogue Web Services, designed to maximize profit without consideration due for societal impacts, directly contribute to the proliferation of cybercrime. This not only puts individual users but also undermines confidence through the broader digital ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, companies such as Rogue Web Services must recognize and adopt their ethical responsibilities to avoid misuse, given the direct impact of their marketing strategies and operational practices in the broader cybercrime panorama.</p>
