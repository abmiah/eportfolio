            <article>

                <p>The article by Corrêa et al. (2023), 'Worldwide AI ethics: A review of 200 guidelines and recommendations for AI governance ', This study conducts a comprehensive global examination of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, providing an in-depth analysis of 200 proposed AI ethics guidelines put forward by various international stakeholders. The article was written academically, requiring multiple readings to grasp the author's point and objective fully; the study uses meta-analysis, a statistical process combining various studies from credible researchers to draw their conclusions. However, Gurevitch et al. (2018) argue that meta-analysis, while a valuable methodological approach, is not without its limitations. The techniques employed in the aggregation of statistical data may inadvertently result in the misrepresentation of findings, thereby obscuring the foundational research upon which these analyses are predicated.</p>
                <p>Corrêa et al. (2023), primary objective of this research is to ascertain the existence of a global consensus on the ethical principles that govern AI development, examining global distribution to assess if there are any principles with AI development. Key findings of the study reveal significant advancements in AI technology, which Corrêa et al. (2023) describe as an “AI ethics boom." This 'boom' refers to the rapid proliferation of AI ethics guidelines and the increasing global attention to ethical considerations in AI development. Furthermore, there has been a notable increase in investment in AI enterprises, with a reported $90 billion allocated to AI companies in the United States during the fiscal year 2021. Subsequent research has elucidated 17 salient principles, including accountability, human rights, autonomy, education, intellectual property, labour rights, privacy, sustainability, transparency, and truthfulness.</p>
                <p>The authors present a series of diagrams relevant to the research, illustrating the various types of institutions from which the study has gathered its data. These institutions include governmental, non-profit, academic, and religious entities. Additional diagrams delineate global regions alongside the corresponding number of publications. This data highlights the inherent biases present in the research conducted.</p>
                <p>The study highlights the significance of establishing transparent and enforceable regulations for managing AI development. It also champions the inclusion of diverse perspectives in discussions about AI ethics. This emphasis on diversity is not just a suggestion but necessary for a comprehensive understanding of AI ethics. Furthermore, the dataset and analytical tools are available to support ongoing research and replication efforts. However, the authors point out several limitations within the research, raising whether the publication requires further unbiased analysis, given AI's pivotal role globally. The authors identified a notable limitation in their study regarding the restricted range of languages available for interpretation, as well as the scope of the research. They emphasised the necessity of incorporating insights from ongoing scholarly discussions, including those shared by media outlets. Moreover, the academic inquiry was limited in its breadth, failing to include perspectives from other regions, particularly concerning issues of gender inequality.</p>
                <p>While discussions about AI have been ongoing for decades, there is a prevalent fear of a dystopian future dominated by AI-powered robots. However, it is crucial to recognise that AI is here to stay, and how we manage its ethical use will shape our society's future. Instead of operating as separate entities, regions should work towards a universal legal framework that addresses the ethical, moral, and social implications of emerging AI technology. This approach can ensure that AI enhances society rather than rendering humans obsolete. As Deckard (2023) points out, the field of AI ethics is a complex area of study that requires a deep understanding of regional economic dynamics and an awareness of the prevailing social and political perspectives on AI advancement.</p>
                <p>Recent advancements have emerged in the governance of artificial intelligence development, mainly through implementing the European Union Artificial Intelligence (EU AI) Act. This legislative framework is a comprehensive guide for regulating AI technologies to mitigate ethical risks. Notably, the EU AI Act seeks to prohibit practices deemed unacceptable, such as social scoring systems analogous to those in China and the employment of AI technologies in high-risk applications aimed at evaluating the suitability of job applicants based on the analysis of their CVs (European Union, 2021).</p>
                <p>Although the UK is not obligated to adhere to the EU AI Act, businesses operating within EU markets must comply with its regulations (Selina, 2024). Nevertheless, the UK has launched an AI Opportunities Action Plan that outlines 50 recommendations for government actions to bolster principles related to AI development (Osborne Clarke, 2025). According to Gov.UK (2024), the AI market is anticipated to surpass $1 trillion by 2035, contributing to societal advancement through job creation, healthcare innovations, and addressing climate change, all while ensuring that AI development proceeds safely to mitigate potential risks.</p>
                <p>The introduction of the DeepSeek chatbot, version R1, in January 2025 marked a notable development within the artificial intelligence landscape. Developed by a Chinese AI firm and utilising open-source licenses, this technology allows users to use and refine the software at a significantly lower cost than OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The emergence of this platform has generated considerable attention in the market, leading to significant declines in the stock valuations of Nvidia and other manufacturers of AI chip technology (Kerner, 2025; Hoskins, 2025). This highlights the competitive nature of AI development and its impact on global markets. However, as AI development continues to affect the market and our daily lives, the ethical side should be at the forefront. According to UNESCO (2021), the implementation of AI yields substantial benefits for advancing human development; however, it concurrently raises significant ethical concerns about the potential biases embedded within AI models. These biases may manifest as discrimination, perpetuation of inequality, prejudice, neglect of animal welfare, and adverse effects on global emissions. The development of AI and the data that powers it must be governed to ensure that it is not misused and does not discriminate. However, it can be challenging for different regions worldwide to come together and create a universal framework, as some regions are in direct competition with one another or have political differences. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI development are vast and promising, offering hope for a brighter future.</p>
