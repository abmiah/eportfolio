                <p>In the context of our professional development initiatives, students have enacted a <b>Skills Matrix</b> , a systematic tool that facilitates the identification and enhancement of individual competencies. This framework not only aids in the assessment of existing skills but also promotes the strategic development of abilities essential for academic and professional growth.</p>
                <p>The table presented below delineates the <em>Skill Matrix</em> , a framework that has been systematically developed and provided by the University of Essex Online. This template serves as a valuable tool for assessing and categorising competencies within a specified context (University of Essex Online, 2025).</p>
