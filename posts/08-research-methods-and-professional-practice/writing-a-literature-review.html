                <p><b>1. What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</b><br>
                The intended audience for this paper comprises scholars, with a particular emphasis on university lecturers and professors.</p>

                <p><b>2. Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</b><br>
                The incidence of ransomware and malware attacks targeting the UK health sector poses significant concerns. Historical instances of ransomware infiltration have led to substantial disruptions within healthcare systems, consequently impacting a considerable segment of the UK population who are either seeking medical guidance or awaiting treatment, some of which may be life-threatening.</p>

                <p><b>3. What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?</b><br>
                This research will adopt a deductive approach to analysing the prevalence of cyber threats encountered by the healthcare sector over the years. It will investigate whether the incidence of such threats is declining or escalating.</p>

                <p><b>4. How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</b><br>
                Data will be sourced from reputable news outlets that specialise in reporting on cyberattacks and authoritative government websites. Depending on the availability of relevant data, additional information may be derived from the National Health Service (NHS) website, YouGov, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and Statista.</p>

                <p><b>5. How is your review structured?</b><br>
                The paper will be structured so that all findings are analysed to conclude. Its basic structure will include a title, research problem, and research question.</p>

                <p><b>6. What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?</b><br>
                The main finding (once the research has commenced) will highlight the prominent cyberattacks that the health system has endured and whether any mitigation plans have been implemented since the incident by examining any post-incident reports to date.</p>

                <p><b>7. What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?</b><br>
                The literature will focus on the UK National Health Service (NHS) and its comparison with the private sector. The available research may be limited, as it may primarily consist of reportable sources with scant academic investigation. Academics might concentrate on the complexities of a cyber attack, such as WannaCry, rather than examining the operations and mitigation strategies within the healthcare sector. Another challenging area is determining the financial impact, as data may not be publicly accessible, but some figures may be available from news outlets, which would need to be verified if possible.</p>

                <p><b>8. Are there any discrepancies in this literature?</b><br>
                Any discrepancies would likely stem from the data. If the data were obtained from the same sources or new data were generated, they may display some variation or inconsistency.</p>

                <p><b>9. What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?</b><br>
                Based on the available research, the conclusion could prompt an independent review of cyber attacks, analysing the factors contributing to these incidents and the potential mitigations that should be enacted. Furthermore, the conclusion should emphasise any lessons learned and the further research needed to prevent future occurrences. The conclusion may adapt in response to the available research, as some data, such as financial records, might not be accessible.</p>
