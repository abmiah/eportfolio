                <p><b>Who is Cambridge Analytica?</b></p>
                <p>Cambridge Analytica, a data consultancy firm based in the United Kingdom, attracted considerable media scrutiny in March 2018 due to its extensive acquisition of user data across various jurisdictions, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The firm was owned by Robert Mercer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and computer scientist from the United States. It was managed by Steve Bannon, who served as a key adviser to Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election and subsequently became the Campaign CEO before his departure in 2017 (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018; FTC, 2019; Schneble et al., 2018). </p>
                <p>According to Amnesty International (2019), Cambridge Analytica reportedly acquired the profiles of over 87 million users from the social media platform Facebook without securing the consent of the individuals involved. The data was procured through an application developed by Professor Aleksandr Kogan titled “This is Your Digital Life.” Kogan asserted that the application was intended for academic research purposes. However, he subsequently disseminated the data to Cambridge Analytica (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018; Hunt and Messinger, 2018), and the app itself allegedly compiled up to 5,000 data points for each user. According to FTC (2019), Kogan’s application misled users by claiming that no personal data would be harvested; nonetheless, it not only collected personal data from the users themselves but also harvested data from their Facebook networks.</p>
                <p><b>What did they do with that data?</b></p>
                <p>According to FTC (2019), Cambridge Analytica claimed to utilise the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a framework established by the United States Department of Commerce in conjunction with the European Commission. This framework is designed to facilitate the transfer of data between organisations while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. The sharing of data is intended to enable companies to bolster trade in a compliant manner (iabeurope.eu, n.d.); however, Cambridge Analytica did not adhere to the Privacy Shield requirements, which, according to FTC (2019), had violated The Federal Trade Commission, due to the engagement in practices deemed deceptive. This is supported by Addy and Watson-Gandy (2019), who state that the misuse of data collected from over 87 million Facebook users.</p>
                <p>According to Addy and Watson-Gandy (2019), the acquisition of data facilitates the ability of Cambridge Analytica to perform psychographic profiling. This capability allows the firm to implement targeted advertising strategies that significantly influence emotional behaviours. Notably, the company's clientele includes political entities involved in high-profile campaigns, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election, particularly the campaign of Donald Trump, as well as the "Leave" campaign during the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018; McCallum, 2022). These campaigns could be perceived as biased, lacking factual accuracy and rooted in misinformation. Cambridge Analytica exploited this misinformation to influence users' perceptions in favour of their clients' campaigns.</p>
                <p>These practices engender numerous ethical, social, legal, and professional concerns; however, this paper will refrain from an in-depth exploration of these issues, as such an undertaking would require a more extensive analysis. Notably, their ethical practices contravened privacy norms by enabling the harvesting of data from over 87 million Facebook users without consent or adequate disclosure of information. Participants in the Kogan application "This Is Your Digital Life" were misled, as Kogan stated that the collected data would be utilised for academic research purposes (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018; Schneble et al., 2018). </p>
                <p>According to Addy and Watson-Gandy (2019), the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) conducted a search of the offices of Cambridge Analytica, resulting in the seizure of multiple servers, records, and accounting books. In November 2018, the ICO identified numerous breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), which subsequently authorised the imposition of a financial penalty on the company.</p>
                <p>Facebook faced significant criticism regarding the Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal and subsequently consented to a 725 million US dollars settlement to resolve legal actions associated with the data breach. While this amount may appear modest compared to the company's market valuation of 1.66 trillion US dollars, it highlights ongoing concerns related to data privacy and corporate accountability (Stockanalysis, 2025; McCallum, 2022). Users place significant trust in platforms to safeguard their personal data. However, this study illustrates the potential oversights of large technology firms in protecting users' information from third-party applications and malicious actors.</p>
