                <p><b>Project title:</b><br>
                Financial Impact of Ransomware and Malware in the Health Sector in the UK?</p>
                <p><b>Introduction: <span class="word-count-red">(300 words)</span> </b><br>
                This section will analyse the historical significance, such as the WannaCry ransomware incident, a major event that disrupted NHS services. The introduction will outline the scope of the paper, examining both the NHS and private sectors and the financial consequences that adversely affected their operations. The paper will specify the research sources, including government websites, official publications, media outlets such as the BBC and The Guardian, and relevant scholarly articles. Additionally, it will identify unexplored areas of research, encompassing optometry, dentistry, and other specialised healthcare sectors. The conclusion will summarise the findings, emphasising key discoveries and potential avenues for further research.</p>
                <p><b>Research question: <span class="word-count-red">(1200 words)</span></b><br>
                This paper's intended audience includes scholars, especially university lecturers and professors. The research incorporates content from accessible government websites, the NHS, private health insurance providers, news outlets, and pertinent scholarly articles from Scholarly websites and online libraries.</p>
                <p>The research will examine two areas: 1) cyber-attacks affecting the National Health Service (NHS) and 2) the private health sector. Both sectors will be investigated concerning the types of cyber incidents they have encountered and any potential financial implications that may have arisen; this could include, for example, disruptions to their services.</p>
                <p>This study employs a deductive approach to assess the prevalence of cyber threats faced by the healthcare sector over time and determine whether their frequency is increasing or decreasing. Data will be gathered from reputable news outlets focusing on cyberattack coverage and credible government websites. If pertinent details are accessible, additional information may be sourced from the National Health Service (NHS) website, YouGov, and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Statista, and it will be organised to evaluate all findings and draw conclusions. Its core structure will include a title, a research problem, and a research question.</p>
                <p>This research aims to highlight the key cyberattacks faced by the health system and to determine whether appropriate mitigation strategies were enacted through a detailed analysis of available post-incident reports. The study will draw comparisons between the UK National Health Service (NHS) and the private sector. Research findings may be constrained, largely relying on reportable sources with limited academic exploration. Scholars typically prioritise the challenges posed by cybersecurity incidents such as WannaCry over evaluating operational dynamics and mitigation strategies within the healthcare sector. Additionally, measuring the financial impact presents difficulties due to the scarcity of public data; however, some figures may be obtainable from news outlets and should be validated when possible. The data likely causes discrepancies, and some variation or inconsistency may occur if the data comes from the same sources or is generated from scratch.</p>
                <p><b>Conclusion: <span class="word-count-red">(500 words)</span> </b><br>
                Research may suggest that the conclusion could promote an independent analysis of cyber-attacks, evaluating the factors behind these incidents and potential mitigation strategies. Furthermore, it should emphasise the lessons learned and identify additional research necessary to prevent future occurrences. The conclusion may differ based on the available research, as certain data, such as financial records, may not be accessible.</p>
