                <p>For this week’s worksheet, one is focusing on the bar charts in Excel.</p>
                <p><b>Exercise 9.1 Example:</b></p>
                <p>The worksheet explained the basic process of creating a bar chart, ensuring the right fields are selected once the bar chart is generated. These fields include the selection from the <b> Add Chart Element </b>. Please note that this feature may differ on a Windows machine, as the example shown is from a Mac.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_01_ex9.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>From this menu, we changed the following aspects of the chart: <b> Axis Title </b>, then select <b> Primary Horizontal Axis Title </b> and rename the title to <b> Area 1</b>. Once again, from the <b> Add Chart Element > Axis Titles > Primary Vertical Axis Title </b>, a vertical label will be created, which we rename to <b> Percentage </b> and a <b> Primary Horizontal Axis Title </b> and renamed to <b> Brand </b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_02_ex9.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>An alternative option suggests removing the gridlines; however, I find them visually appealing as they indicate the data points.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_03_ex9.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>I have also included the data labels to show the figures from the spreadsheet, <b> Add Chart Element > Data Labels > Outside End </b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_04_ex9.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>The outcome was a bar graph from <b> Area 1</b> representing percentages. The chart clearly indicates that <b> Brand A </b> is the least preferred option at <b>15.7%</b>, while <b> Brand B </b>  is the second choice at <b>24.3%</b>. Lastly, the <b> Other Brand </b>, with <b>60%</b>, stands out as the most favoured option compared to the other two brands. </p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_05_ex9.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p><b>Exercise 9.1:</b></p>
                <p>To finish this task, we will use the file <b> Exe 9.1D.xlsx </b> found in the Exercises folder. This document contains the percentage frequencies along with the bar chart generated in the earlier example. Construct a percentage frequency bar chart that illustrates the brand preferences for <b> Area 2</b>, using the format employed for the <b> Area 1</b> results demonstrated previously. Then, place your newly created chart adjacent to the one for <b> Area 1</b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_06_ex9.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>In <b> Area 2</b>, which I colour-coded to orange to differentiate it from <b> Area 1</b>, the data suggests that <b> Brand A </b> is the least favoured with <b>21.1%</b>. However, comparing this to <b> Area 1</b>, which is only <b>15.7%</b>, it seems that in <b> Area 2, Brand A </b> is slightly more favoured compared to <b> Area 1</b>. <b> Brand B </b> scored <b>33.3%</b>, making it the second favoured brand, while the <b> Other Brand </b> scored <b>45.6%</b>, resulting in only a <b>12.3% </b> difference. Compared to <b> Area 1</b>, the difference between <b> Brand B </b> and the <b> Other Brand</b> is <b>35.7%</b>.</p>
                <p>In terms of frequencies, <b> Brand A </b> scored 19, <b> Brand A </b>  scored 30, and the <b> Other Brand </b> scored 41. Once again, the difference between <b> Brand B </b>   and the <b> Other Brand </b> in <b> Area 2</b> is only <b>11</b>. However, it must be noted that in <b> Area 2</b>, more data was collected, totalling <b>90</b>, compared to Area 1, totalling <b>70</b>. This results in a difference of <b>20</b>, making it a slightly biased result.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_07_ex9.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p><b>Exercise 9.2:</b></p>
                <p>For this exercise, we need to open the file <b> Exa 9.2E.xlsx </b>, which contains sets of data on <b> frequencies </b> and <b> percentages </b> based on <b> Location A </b> and <b> Location B </b>. From this, we need to create a clustered column bar chart that displays the percentage frequency of heather species in the two locations and then provide a brief interpretation of the findings.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_02_ex9_2.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>
                <p>Looking at the <b> Frequencies </b> chart, the <b> Absent </b> category for <b> Location B </b>, which is <b>20</b>, is greater than <b> Location A </b>,, which is <b>8</b>, by a difference of <b>12</b>. However, for the <b> Spares </b> category, Location A performs slightly better with <b>22</b> compared to <b> Location B </b>'s <b>14</b>, showing a difference of <b>8</b>. Additionally, in the <b> Abundant </b> category, <b> Location A </b> exceeds <b> Location B </b>, with <b> A </b> having <b>26</b> and <b> B </b> having <b>10</b>, resulting in a difference of <b>16</b>.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that while it was not part of the required brief, I have also included the <b> total </b> count, which shows that <b> Location A </b> has <b>56</b> and <b> Location B </b> has <b>44</b>. This results in a difference of <b>12</b>, indicating that it is not a fair test since <b> Location A </b> has 12 more data sets than <b> Location B </b>. Additionally, this may also indicate  that <b> Location A </b> is better for <b> Spares </b> and <b>Abundant</b>, while <b> Location B </b> clearly dominates in <b>Absent</b>.</p>
                <p>The percentage chart also illustrates the data variation similar to the Frequencies; however, in <b>Location B</b>, the data indicate <b>45.5% Absent</b>, while <b>Location A</b> has only <b>14.3% Absent</b>, a difference of <b>31.2%</b>, which is more than double that of <b>Location A</b>. The <b>Spares</b> from both locations are relatively close, with <b>Location A</b> at <b>39.3%</b> and <b>Location B</b> at <b>31.8%</b>, a difference of <b>7.5%</b>. For the <b>Abundant</b> species, <b>Location A</b> records a higher percentage of <b>46.4%</b> compared to <b>Location B</b>'s <b>22.7%</b>, resulting in a difference of <b>23.7%</b>, nearly double that of <b>Location B</b>.</p>
                <p>Once again, it should be noted that, similar to the data from the <b>Frequencies</b>, <b>Location A</b> has a higher total compared to <b>Location B</b>. If they  both had an equal total in their locations, the percentage may differ.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_03_ex9_2.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p><b>Exercise 9.3 Example:</b></p>
                <p>For this example, we need to create a histogram by opening the file <b>Exa 9.3B.xlsa</b>, which contains the relevant data. We filled in the following set of data using <b>=Min()</b>, <b>=Max()</b>, and then obtained the average of <b>Max() – Min()</b> for <b>Diet A</b>.</p>
                <p>For the second part, we entered the upper-class boundaries <b>(UCB)</b> and set the values from <b>0, 2, 4</b> up to <b>12</b>, based on the documentation. Since the minimum value is <b>-1.715</b> and the maximum value is <b>10.062</b>, it will start with a class of <b>(-2, 0)</b>, and the remaining classes will be <b>0, 2,</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_01_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>In the third part, we entered the array formal <b>=FREQUENCY(data_array, bin_array)</b> and then pressed <b>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</b>; since I am on a Mac, the commands will be <b>Command+Shift+Enter</b>. The complete function looks like this <b>=FREQUENCY(B2:B52, H4:H10)</b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_02_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>By doing this, I have encountered a few issues, as a zero will be entered. I understand that <b>=FREQUENCY </b> adds an additional zero, which may be due to the fact that the <b>=FREQUENCY </b> function produces one extra element compared to the number of bins. To solve this I entered one less data so the function looks like this <b>=FREQUENCY(B2:B52, H4:H9)</b> so this would avoid the extra zero also the <b>Command+Shift+Enter</b> result in <b>#SPILL!</b> output, I therefore just press <b>Enter</b> to get the results.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_03_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>The subsequent step involved verifying that the histogram aligns with the class boundaries, which will be illustrated in the <b>Class Mark</b> section of the cell. This alignment is achieved by <b>averaging</b> the <b>upper</b>- and <b>lower-class</b> boundaries; for example <b>(-2,0]</b> the formula will <b> =(-2+0)/2</b>  output <b>-1</b> data obtained from <b>UCB</b>.</p>
                <p>Not on the <b>UCB</b>; you can clearly see there is no data indicating <b>-2</b>. This was manually added; the other cell had the following formula: <b>=(H4+H5)/2</b>.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_04_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>In the next section, we will calculate the <b>Relative Frequency</b> using the formula from the Relative Frequency cell <b>=Frequency / Total Frequency</b>, then add the total from <b>the Relative Frequency</b> cell.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_05_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>The next section will involve creating the chart from the <b>Relative Frequency</b> cell. To close the gap on the chart, select <b>Layout 8</b> from the <b>Quick Layout</b> menu, which will eliminate the gaps in the graph.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_06_ex9_3.png" width="50%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>From here, we will select the data from the <b>Select Data</b> menu, which will open the <b>Select Data</b> option under the section labelled <b>Horizontal (category) axis labels</b>, pick the cells from <b>Class Mark</b> and then click <b>OK</b>. There is some additional editing required to better format the graph. This includes adding the relevant labels to the chart, including the <b>title</b> and names for the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> values, as well as adding border colour around the individual bar graph itself.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_07_ex9_3.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_08_ex9_3.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>The chart shows that participants in the Diet A programme experience a weight loss distribution that is both unimodal and symmetrical, albeit with a slight negative skew</p>

                <p><b>Exercise 9.3:</b></p>
                <p>For this exercise, we will be working with the same file, <b>Exe 9.3B.xlsx</b>, which contains the <b>Relative Frequency</b> table we used for <b>Diet A</b>. Based on the working example we completed for <b>Diet A</b>, we are now required to complete  the relevant tables for <b>Diet B</b> and produce a histogram using the same table format settings.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_09_ex9_3.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>Based on the data provided, the highest point on the histogram is <b>3kg</b>, which suggests that most of the participants involved in <b>Diet B</b> lost an average weight of <b>3kg</b>. The histogram itself shows a good distribution, with many participants losing between <b>1kg</b> and <b>7kg</b>, and only a few individuals experiencing extreme weight loss. It must be noted that some participants did gain weight during the study, as indicated by the negative number <b>-1</b>, and a few participants lost a significant amount, between <b>9kg</b> and <b>11kg</b>, but these are only a few cases. Overall, the majority of participants in <b>Diet B</b> lost an average of <b>3</b> to <b>5kg</b>, which the histogram is centred around, while some did not lose weight or even gained weight, and a small portion lost a significant amount.</p>
                <img src="../../images/articles_imgs/chart-worksheets/image_10_ex9_3.png" width="100%"  alt="">
                <br><br>

                <p>Comparing the two sets of data from <b>Diet A</b> and <b>Diet B</b>, the histogram suggests that <b>Diet A</b> is more effective than <b>Diet B</b>, given that the average weight lost from <b>Diet A</b> is centred around <b>5</b> to <b>7kg</b>, while <b>Diet B</b> is centred around <b>3</b> to <b>5kg</b>. Both sets show that some participants either lost no weight or gained weight, but they also indicate that some participants lost a significant amount of weight. However, in terms of consistency, it appears that <b>Diet B</b> demonstrates better predictability due to the significant differences in weight loss shown in the chart.</p>
