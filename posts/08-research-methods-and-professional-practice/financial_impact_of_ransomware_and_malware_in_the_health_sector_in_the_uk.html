                <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>
                <p>Regardless of the perspective one adopts, cybercrime represents an increasing trend that poses significant risks to both individuals and organisations. Its consequences can be profoundly detrimental. Particularly concerning are the attacks perpetrated by malicious actors against critical institutions, such as the healthcare sector, where the ramifications extend beyond the organisations themselves, ultimately affecting patients who become unwarranted victims of circumstances beyond their control. According to Nguyen (2024), data breaches originating from the healthcare sector are projected to impose an average annual cost of 10.92 million US dollars globally. Notably, 74% of these breaches are attributed to phishing scams, with ransomware and malware accounting for 37%. While one might contend that phishing scams, such as emails from suspicious senders urging recipients to click on links or open attachments, primarily result in the infection of a single computer with malware, the National Cyber Security Centre (2018) emphasises that phishing emails often contain links to malicious websites, which can facilitate the propagation of malware, including ransomware. Such incidents potentially compromise the operational integrity of organisations, a severe threat that cannot be overlooked.</p>
                <p>Evaluating the financial impacts of a cyber incident poses considerable challenges, often bordering on the impractical. This difficulty stems from the complexities of restoring affected equipment and rebuilding customer trust through brand rehabilitation. Moreover, many organisations may choose not to disclose the full extent of such incidents, primarily due to inadequate investment in effective cyber-attack mitigation strategies (Bendovschi, 2015; Fotis, 2024).</p>
                <p>This paper aims to investigate the financial implications resulting from cyber-attacks on the NHS, primarily from the WannaCry ransomware. It will critically analyse the impact on their operational integrity and assess the extent to which mitigation measures have been implemented to prevent future incidents. The scope of this inquiry will deliberately exclude specialised healthcare areas such as dentistry, orthopaedics, optometry, individual GP practices and the private healthcare sector. Moreover, while a brief overview of the global market will be considered, the primary focus of this examination remains centred on the United Kingdom, where the NHS operates prominently.</p>
                <p><b>2. Research question</b></p>
                <p><b>2.1. How cybercrime evolved.</b></p>
                <p>The first recorded instance of cybercrime with substantial financial ramifications transpired in 1970 in New York. In this particular case, Roswell Steffen, a chief teller at the Union Dime Savings Bank, engaged in the manipulation of the bank's computer system to falsify account records, embezzling over 1.5 million US dollars from various customer accounts over three years (Caffier, 2023; Crowell, 2014). This offence serves as a salient example of an insider threat, wherein an individual possessing access to internal systems and customer data exploits their position for personal financial gain. Moreover, it highlights the challenges that organisations encounter in the identification of potential cyber incidents. According to Fosburgh (2024), Steffen adeptly evaded detection by concealing his computer activities and modifying the account records of the impacted customers to ensure they retained the appearance of accuracy.</p>
                <p>In today’s digital landscape, organisations across diverse sectors, including finance, non-profit, or Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), are increasingly susceptible to a multitude of cyber threats. These threats manifest in several forms, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, brute force attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), malware, phishing, social engineering, supply chain attacks, and DNS tunnelling, among others (Baker, 2024; Bendovschi, 2015), in contrast to the case of Steffen, who is classified as a malicious insider, cyber-attacks often take place beyond the jurisdiction of nation-states. This geographical detachment introduces significant complexities in holding threat actors accountable and facilitating their prosecution. According to Tehrani et al. (2013), international cybercrime, commonly referred to as “cyber terrorism," represents an increasing concern that necessitates robust internal corporate responses; there are allegations that the WannaCry malware may have been developed by the Lazarus Group, a cybercriminal organisation with purported connections to the North Korean government (Fruhlinger, 2022). Furthermore, when a state seeks to invoke its domestic laws to pursue justice against perpetrators, challenges arise if that state denies any wrongdoing and fails to cooperate with international legal frameworks. Such scenarios highlight the complexities inherent in addressing cybercrime on a global scale.</p>
                <p><b>2.2. The first cyber incident on the NHS.</b></p>
                <p>The first recorded cyberattack targeting the National Health Service (NHS) transpired in October 2016, during which the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole (NLAG) NHS Foundation Trust was compromised by Globe2 ransomware, which affects systems compromised through phishing techniques disseminated via electronic mail, which typically includes hyperlinks that either facilitate the download of malware or redirect users to websites hosting malicious software. This incident precipitated the cancellation of approximately 2,800 medical appointments. The malware reportedly infiltrated their electronic systems, compelling officials to execute a controlled shutdown of the affected system in an effort to contain the malicious software and mitigate its propagation to other segments of the infrastructure, thereby averting additional impairment (BBC News, 2016; National Audit Office, 2018; Palmer, 2016).</p>
                <p>The financial implications of the incident on the North Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust (NLAG) have not been publicly disclosed, rendering it difficult to ascertain the precise financial impact. However, it is evident that such incidents typically necessitate significant operational adjustments, including the replacement of IT equipment, restoration of systems, and potentially increased staffing hours to manage the aftermath. According to Palmer (2016), following an inquiry with an NHS spokesperson, no ransom was paid to the threat actors involved in the incident. Prior to the event at the North Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust in 2016, the Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust had experienced a cyber incident, having allegedly faced multiple unsuccessful attacks throughout the year (National Audit Office, 2018). This incident should have prompted senior management to implement measures to mitigate future cyber incidents. These measures should include comprehensive staff training to recognise potential phishing attempts, such as those associated with the Globe2 ransomware.</p>
                <p>According to the House of Commons (2018), numerous communications dating back to early 2014 were directed to the NHS concerning the urgent need to update outdated systems and software. A significant portion of these systems was still operating on Microsoft Windows XP, for which Microsoft officially terminated support by ceasing to provide updates or patches effective from 8th April 2014 (Microsoft, n.d.). Consequently, when the NHS encountered its first significant cyber incident in 2017, approximately 5% of the IT infrastructure within the NHS estate continued to utilise Windows XP. Subsequent warnings were issued to the Trust, urging them to secure their operating systems; however, it was reported that only two-thirds had implemented the necessary system patches.</p>
                <p>In May 2017, the NHS confronted a significant cybersecurity threat when the WannaCry ransomware virus disseminated globally, impacting over 230,000 computer systems across more than 150 nations. The virus exploits vulnerabilities in computer networks, specifically targeting the Windows XP operating system, subsequently encrypting files stored on the device's hard drive and obstructing user access. Following this encryption, it demands a ransom payment in Bitcoin for the decryption of the affected files, a category of extortion classified as crypto-ransomware (Ehrenfeld, 2017; Fruhlinger, 2022; Kaspersky, 2024; National Audit Office, 2018).</p>
                <p>According to Ehrenfeld (2017), the ransomware's impact on the NHS had significant adverse consequences for patients. This was exacerbated by the fact that numerous essential pieces of equipment, including MRI scanners, biological storage refrigerators, and computer systems, remained inoperative on the obsolete Windows XP operating system, resulting in significant postponements of planned surgical procedures and medical treatments (Portela et al., 2022).</p>
                <p>According to Alford (2019), the financial impact of the WannaCry attack amounted to a loss of £5.9 million. Of this total, £4 million was attributable to inpatient admissions. This assertion is further supported by Ghafur et al. (2019), who delineates that the losses associated with these admissions included approximately £0.6 million was lost due to A&E services and £1.3 million resulted from cancelled appointments. Ghafur et al. (2019) assert that if the trusts have experienced the effects of the virus in a manner analogous to the actual trust, the estimated losses could amount to £35 million. This estimation is contingent upon data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).  According to Gov.UK (2018) argues that the financial loss resulting from the incident is approximately £92 million. It is important to note that this figure is an estimate derived from the actual cyber-attack that occurred between 12 and 18 May 2018 and the subsequent recovery period in June and July 2017. The financial implications can be categorised into two primary areas: direct impact, which encompasses the loss of patient throughput and additional IT support required for data restoration within the NHS.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Gov.UK (2018) indicates a deficit of comprehensive data regarding the financial implications related to IT recovery and the degree of disruption encountered by patients. To attain an accurate evaluation of the financial repercussions of the incident, it is imperative to gather data from all NHS Trusts alongside any external organisations that offer IT support. The process of data collection in itself is likely to impose considerable financial burdens on the NHS system. </p>
                <p>Based on the presented data, it is essential to establish that the figures indicated cannot be construed as a conclusive determination regarding the financial repercussions affecting the NHS during the WannaCry ransomware cyber incident. This assertion is predicated on the inadequacy of data collected from all NHS trusts, which renders the reported figure of £92 million merely an extrapolation derived from the documented losses of £5.9 million. Larger institutions, such as Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which is regarded as the largest hospital in the UK by bed count (Interweave Healthcare, 2020), are posited to possess a more extensive operational capacity, thereby experiencing a more pronounced impact from the WannaCry attack compared to Sunderland Royal Hospital, for instance, which has a capacity of 814 beds (Interweave Healthcare, 2020). Consequently, these two NHS hospitals should not be assumed to share a similar operational experience; instead, they ought to be examined independently to ascertain the damages incurred due to the ransomware incident. It is important to acknowledge that the examples provided herein represent only a subset of NHS hospitals; the comprehensive list of all NHS hospitals impacted by the WannaCry cyber-attack has yet to be made publicly available. According to the House of Commons (2018), a recorded number of ransomware infections affected 603 NHS organisations. UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt states that 80% of the NHS remained unaffected (BBC News, 2017; Collier, 2017). However, this assertion lacks support from independent or scholarly research, raising questions about its validity. Furthermore, research indicates, according to Gov.UK (2018), that no data was ascertained regarding the expenses associated with the recovery of IT infrastructure, thereby leaving the actual cost of the impact indeterminate.</p>
                <p><b>3. Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>On the 3rd of June 2024, the NHS pathology testing facility Synnovis experienced a significant cyber incident attributed to the purported Russian cyber-criminal group known as Qilin. This group disclosed 400 gigabytes (GB) of sensitive patient data on the dark web and issued a ransom demand to Synnovis (Casey, 2024; Gabert-Doyon, 2025; NCSC, 2024). This incident underscores that, despite the lessons learned from the WannaCry attack, which should have prompted the NHS to enhance its cybersecurity measures, malicious actors continually seek vulnerabilities to exploit organisations for financial benefit. It is important to clarify that WannaCry did not explicitly target the NHS; rather, it leveraged a vulnerability in the Windows XP operating system, resulting in a widespread global impact. The NHS was notably reliant on several outdated operating systems no longer supported by Microsoft, indicating a considerable oversight in its IT management practices. According to Portela et al. (2022), the healthcare sector remains an attractive target for cybercriminals due to the extensive data it manages, with an upward trend in such attacks being observed. The long-term financial repercussions of WannaCry remain indeterminate, primarily due to a lack of independent assessments. Available research primarily relies on assumptions, and the NHS has acknowledged the absence of data concerning the costs associated with recovering its IT infrastructure; nevertheless, the incident has undeniably inflicted lasting damage on the NHS's reputation. Despite these challenges, patients depend on the NHS for their healthcare needs and well-being. The NHS must prioritise cybersecurity with immediate urgency, ensuring that systems are kept up to date, data is properly encrypted and backed up, and that networks are segmented from medical devices to mitigate the risk of breaches affecting other critical systems (House of Commons, 2018).</p>
