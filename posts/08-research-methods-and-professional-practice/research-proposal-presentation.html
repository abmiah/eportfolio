                <p><b>Project Title.</b><br>
                Cyberbullying, how serious is it, and what impact does it have in the UK? </p>

                <p><b>Significance/Contribution to the discipline/Research Problem.</b><br>
                The research will aim to examine the impact of cyberbullying and whether current legislation addresses this issue.</p>

                <p><b>Research Question.</b><br>
                With the rise of the digital market, we are increasingly connected to the digital sphere, particularly through popular social media platforms like Facebook, which, according to Aslam (2022), has 2.96 billion monthly active users out of a global population of 8.2 billion (Worldometer, 2024). This means that 37% of the world's population uses Facebook alone. However, with any social interaction, the threat level of cybercrime, discrimination, online harassment, grooming gangs, and cyberbullying has also increased. How are social media companies and the laws of various countries managing these issues? </p>

                <p><b>Aims and Objectives.</b><br>
                The aim is to examine the current legislation in the UK that protects individuals from cyberbullying, the effects of cyberbullying on individuals, and to outline the causes of cyberbullying.  </p>

                <p><b>Key literature related to the project.</b><br>
                The research will examine data available from government websites and any official documentation that offers statistics to support the subject matter.</p>

                <p><b>Methodology/Development strategy/Research Design.</b><br>
                The research will employ a deductive method, whereby conclusions should be drawn. However, this may change to an inductive approach while conducting the research, resulting in a mixed research methodology.  </p>

                <p><b>Ethical considerations and risk assessment (as part of your ethical approval application).</b><br>
                Some of the research may lead to controversial subject areas, such as child grooming, which is a topic I do not wish to explore. However, cyberbullying may touch upon these areas; while they should be acknowledged, they will not be a primary focus. Regarding the research, one must ensure it is conducted from a non-biased perspective, considering every aspect. The research may conclude that the subject matter is not a concern when it comes to cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><b>Description of artefact(s) that will be created (if applicable).</b><br>
                The research will look into scholarly articles where available and current government legislation; any data collected will be from academic sources. </p>

                <p><b>Timeline of proposed activities.</b><br>
                The deadline for this project is set for 7th April 2025, and the timeline will consist of the following:</p>
                <ul>
