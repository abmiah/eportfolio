                <p> Embracing a risk-based approach to cybersecurity empowers companies to apply the most appropriate level of control to potential risks. This leads to more effective risk management and offers a more economical solution, instilling confidence in the strategy's value proposition.</p>
                <p> An increasing number of businesses are embracing a risk-based strategy for safeguarding their digital infrastructure. This approach empowers them to evaluate potential threats and implement the most fitting measures to counteract them. By doing so, they enhance their risk management capabilities and optimise their spending, instilling greater confidence in their security measures.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> While AI and machine learning are crucial for automating threat detection and response, adopting a proactive approach is essential to stay ahead of cybercriminals. This emphasis on vigilance and preparedness is critical for successfully navigating the ongoing cybersecurity challenge.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Zero-trust security models are not just a trend but a necessity in today's digital landscape. These models assume that no user, device, or application can be trusted unless verified. For instance, a company may implement multi-factor authentication for all users, regardless of location or device. This approach plays a pivotal role in preventing data theft and exfiltration by underscoring the significance of verifying all entities in the digital realm. This urgency and importance should not be underestimated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Cloud services now require new security methods, including identity management with single sign-on and role-based access, data protection with encryption and backups, threat detection with continuous monitoring and anomaly detection, and compliance ensured through audits and industry standards.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> In the future, risk management is poised to become more dynamic and risk-based, with the integration of advanced technologies, zero-trust principles, and cyber resilience becoming paramount for addressing evolving threats and regulatory requirements (Boehm et al., 2019; ENISA, 2022; Onestepsecureit.com, n.d.). </p>
                <p> <b>The most common cyber threats in the current landscape</b><br> Cybersecurity threats are not just a concern but a significant and growing one for organisations of all sizes. Fleck (2022) from Statista reports that global cybercrime is anticipated to soar to $13 trillion by 2028, an alarming trend that should be a serious concern for all organisations. Petrosyan (2023) further supports this notion, indicating that the tendency for cybercrime is rising. To this end, it is essential to be aware of common types of cyber-attacks outlined below and take immediate action to protect against them.</p>
                <p> <b>Ransomware</b> attacks target organisations and critical infrastructure, disrupting healthcare systems and more.</p>
                <p> <b>Supply chain attacks,</b> which have become more common in recent years, target third-party vendors or software providers to gain access to an organisation's systems.</p>
                <p> <b>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</b> is a social engineering technique in which cybercriminals impersonate trusted parties to trick employees into making fraudulent wire transfers or disclosing sensitive information. This technique causes significant financial losses for organisations worldwide.</p>
                <p> <b>IoT</b> devices with weak security controls are popular targets for cybercriminals to access networks and launch attacks.</p>
                <p> <b>State-sponsored attacks</b> pose significant threats as nation-states engage in cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, and critical infrastructure disruption.</p>
                <p> <b>AI attacks</b> are becoming more sophisticated and targeted. Attackers use AI to automate social engineering attacks and improve malware detection evasion.</p>
                <p> <b>Data breaches</b> are a significant concern, especially in Australia's health sector. Phishing, stolen usernames and passwords, and ransomware are the leading causes.</p>
                <p> The landscape of cyber threats is complex, diverse, and constantly evolving. Organisations must remain vigilant and implement robust security measures to safeguard against advanced ransomware, supply chain attacks, social engineering techniques, and state-sponsored cyber espionage. It is imperative to stay current with the most recent security practices to ensure optimal protection. Failure to do so may result in significant security vulnerabilities that could have far-reaching and detrimental consequences (Allan, 2023; Chipeta, 2022; Daugherty, 2023; IanIndexsy, 2023).</p>
