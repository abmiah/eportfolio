                <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
                <p> Read the website at <a href="https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies" target="_blank">Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data Protection Commission.</a> There are several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. Chose a case study and answer the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</i>
                    <li>How was it resolved?</i>
                    <li>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</i>
                </ul>
                <h2>Case study: Case Study 1: Marketing offences by MTS Property Management Limited – prosecution</h2>
                <p> <strong>Summary:</strong></p>
                <p> In a legal case involving Marketing Offenses, MTS Property Management Limited was found to have sent unsolicited marketing Short Message Service (SMS) messages to an individual without their consent. Despite interacting with the company, the individual was never permitted to use their mobile phone number for marketing purposes and reported no option to opt out of the messages. Although MTS initially denied any knowledge of the mobile number and account holder, an investigation confirmed their responsibility for the messages, resulting in prosecution for the offences (Dataprotection.ie, 2024).</p>
                <p> This was not the first time MTS had faced such complaints, as similar issues arose in 2010. After receiving a warning, MTS was prosecuted again in 2015 for sending unsolicited marketing SMS messages without consent and failing to provide an opt-out mechanism. The Dublin Metropolitan District Court found the company guilty on both counts, imposing a fine of €1,000 for each offence. In addition, MTS agreed to cover the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner (Dataprotection.ie, 2024).</p>
                <p> <strong>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</strong></p>
                <p> In 2015, the Dublin Metropolitan District Court fined a company for sending unsolicited marketing SMS messages without obtaining the necessary consent. The messages did not include an opt-out mechanism and were sent without the individuals' consent to receive marketing messages.</p>
                <p> <strong>How was it resolved?</strong></p>
                <p> The legal case study about MTS Property Management Limited's marketing offences has been resolved through legal proceedings. MTS Property Management Limited admitted to transmitting unsolicited marketing SMS messages without prior consent and neglecting to include an opt-out choice in such messages. Consequently, the Dublin Metropolitan District Court found the defendant guilty on both charges and imposed a penalty of €1,000 each. Furthermore, MTS Property Management Limited has agreed to bear the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
                <p><strong> If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</strong></p>
                <p> An information security manager is advised to undertake several crucial steps to mitigate the situation and address issues similar to those presented in the case study involving MTS Property Management Limited.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Consent Procedures:</strong> Obtaining explicit consent from individuals before engaging in marketing activities involving their data, particularly phone numbers, is imperative. Establishing transparent opt-in mechanisms and providing individuals with convenient and effortless means to opt out of any marketing communications is highly recommended. Failure to do so may result in a breach of privacy and trust, potentially leading to negative consequences for the individuals and the organisation.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Auditing and Monitoring:</strong> Periodic audits are imperative to verify adherence to data protection regulations. Additionally, it is crucial to closely monitor marketing activities to ensure that all communications comply with consent requirements and incorporate opt-out options.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Employee Training:</strong> Extensive training is imperative for all personnel involved in marketing activities, handling personal data, obtaining consent, and complying with data protection laws and privacy rights. Employees must know the significance of obtaining consent and respecting individuals' privacy rights.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Documentation and Record-Keeping:</strong> Maintaining comprehensive and meticulous records of all consents obtained for marketing activities is imperative. Additionally, it is essential to document all opt-in and opt-out requests to demonstrate compliance in the event of any complaints or investigations.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Response Plan for Complaints:</strong> It is imperative to develop a structured response plan to handle complaints about unsolicited marketing or data privacy issues effectively. Conducting thorough investigations, employing corrective measures, and maintaining high transparency in all communication with complainants are essential to ensuring prompt and efficient resolution of complaints.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Compliance Checks:</strong> Periodic compliance checks must strictly adhere to data protection regulations. Any non-compliance issues must be addressed urgently, and corrective measures should be implemented promptly to prevent future violations.</li>
                </ol>
