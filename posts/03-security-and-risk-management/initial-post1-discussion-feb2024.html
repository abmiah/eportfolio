            <article>
                <p>The mention of the Industrial Revolution often conjures images of the steam engines that emerged in the early 1700s in Britain, factories brimming with smoke, the utilisation of coal and iron, and ground-breaking technological progress. A host of celebrated engineers made significant contributions to this period, from Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who constructed railways, bridges, tunnels, and massive steamships, to Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who led the way in creating the London sewage system that remains in operation today (Cartwright, 2023; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024; History.com Editors, 2023; Institution of Civil Engineers, 2022).</p>
                <p>When one reflects on the past, the 18th century marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Today, society is undergoing a new era of industrialisation known as Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Unlike the earlier revolution, which relied on steam power and manual labour, Industry 4.0 is powered by machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analysis. These innovative technologies converge to form the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019; McKinsey & Company, 2022; Toth, 2022; Hetler, 2023).</p>
                <p>As technology and IoTs evolve, the danger of cybercriminals exploiting potential system vulnerabilities grows. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) have identified five categories of risk: Technical, Competence, Behavioural, Data Security, and Financial. Vitlinskyy and Skitsko (2016), on the other hand, have classified risks into the following areas: Investment, Innovation Activity, Industrial Espionage and Competitive Intelligence, and Intellectual and Human Resources.</p>
                <p>In 2023, several cyber attacks were classified according to risk categories outlined by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). One of these incidents was the Royal Mail ransomware attack, which LockBit carried out. As a result of this attack, data was stolen, and Royal Mail's international delivery services were disrupted, making it clear that data security is paramount. Another incident involved the Clop Ransomware Gang exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit system. A zero-day vulnerability is when threat actors discover a weakness before the organisation and have no available patches to fix it (Kaspersky, 2018). This is an example of a Technical risk that falls under Kovaitė and Stankevičienė's (2019) risk category (Coker, 2023; Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019).</p>

                    <p><em>by Mohammed Younes - Tuesday, 6 February 2024, 11:16 AM</em></p>
                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your insightful overview of the Industrial Revolution and its transition to the current era of Industry 4.0. Indeed AI, machine learning and other digital technologies have played a transformative role in the industry 4.0 which raised risks as highlighted by (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019).</p>
                    <p>For example, competence risks and the need of new skills and competencies in industry 4.0; Kazançoglu and Özkan Özen (2018) argue that it will be vital to establish new criteria to hire and evaluate the human workforce. Moreover, Hecklau et al (2016) highlight the scarcity of qualified workers to meet the industry 4.0 challenges, which makes it a critical factor in the process of adjusting businesses to the industry 4.0 landscape, thus executives and recruiters now seek innovative behavior, critical thinking, knowledge and adaptation to technology during the recruitment and screening of applicants during the hiring processes.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I agree with your comment regarding the danger of cyber threats and cybercriminals exploiting potential system vulnerabilities in the context of new evolving technologies. The technological advancements and associated risks in the realm of Industry 4.0 really provides a thought-provoking perspective on the intricate interplay between innovation and security. Hence, it would be important to have proactive risk management strategies in place for businesses to survive in this rapidly changing landscape.</p>

                    <p><em>by Anja Kosar - Sunday, 11 February 2024, 8:49 PM</em></p>
                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    <p>This is a very interesting post and I have enjoyed your time loop use of providing a historical outlook on industry revolutions and where we are today, highlighting how far we have come. From steam power and manual labor, to artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced data analytics and IoT.</p>
                    <p>In today’s world, technology plays a crucial role in the smooth and continuous flow of information and communication, which is essential for the success of any business. The evolution and constant improvement of technology have brought about the industry 4.0 revolution, which has transformed various sectors, including technology, industries, and infrastructure. This has also brought in new risk types and how we address them.</p>
                    <p>Kovaite and Stankeviciene (2019) have identified 5 categories of risk, Technical, Competence, Behavioral, Data Security and Financial. Your use of examples highlights these perfectly. It also reminded me of the Knight Capital Group $440 million Software error. Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading, gaining the reputation of being one of the largest traders in US equities. It took 17 years of dedicated work to build Knight Capital Group into one of the leading trading houses on Wall Street. And it all nearly ended in less than one hour. At Knight, some new trading software contained a flaw that became apparent only after the software was activated when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opened that day. The errant software sent Knight on a buying spree, snapping up 150 different stocks at a total cost of around $7 billion, all in the first hour of trading. Knight attempted to cancel some of the purchases, however some stood confirmed, resulting in the massive blow to the company. (Alqudhaibi, Albarrak, Aloseel, Jagtap & Salonitis, 2023) This highlights another important example of technical risk.</p>
