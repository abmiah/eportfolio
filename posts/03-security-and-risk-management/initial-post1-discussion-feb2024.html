            <article>
                <p>The mention of the Industrial Revolution often conjures images of the steam engines that emerged in the early 1700s in Britain, factories brimming with smoke, the utilisation of coal and iron, and ground-breaking technological progress. A host of celebrated engineers made significant contributions to this period, from Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who constructed railways, bridges, tunnels, and massive steamships, to Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who led the way in creating the London sewage system that remains in operation today (Cartwright, 2023; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024; History.com Editors, 2023; Institution of Civil Engineers, 2022).</p>
                <p>When one reflects on the past, the 18th century marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Today, society is undergoing a new era of industrialisation known as Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Unlike the earlier revolution, which relied on steam power and manual labour, Industry 4.0 is powered by machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analysis. These innovative technologies converge to form the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019; McKinsey & Company, 2022; Toth, 2022; Hetler, 2023).</p>
                <p>As technology and IoTs evolve, the danger of cybercriminals exploiting potential system vulnerabilities grows. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) have identified five categories of risk: Technical, Competence, Behavioural, Data Security, and Financial. Vitlinskyy and Skitsko (2016), on the other hand, have classified risks into the following areas: Investment, Innovation Activity, Industrial Espionage and Competitive Intelligence, and Intellectual and Human Resources.</p>
                <p>In 2023, several cyber attacks were classified according to risk categories outlined by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). One of these incidents was the Royal Mail ransomware attack, which LockBit carried out. As a result of this attack, data was stolen, and Royal Mail's international delivery services were disrupted, making it clear that data security is paramount. Another incident involved the Clop Ransomware Gang exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit system. A zero-day vulnerability is when threat actors discover a weakness before the organisation and have no available patches to fix it (Kaspersky, 2018). This is an example of a Technical risk that falls under Kovaitė and Stankevičienė's (2019) risk category (Coker, 2023; Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019).</p>

                    <p><em>by Anja Kosar - Tuesday, 14 November 2023, 6:36 PM</em></p>
                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    <p>I admire your first sentence and comparison of Homo Sapiens settlements to today, 2023, which is a great representation of how far we have come, as people, and as technology. You also mention the use of artificial intelligence and IoT. I do agree that breakthroughs in intelligent human-computer interaction technology often open up new digital service scenarios. The IoT also simplifies and automates tasks that are complicated and sometimes beyond the scope of human capabilities.</p>
                    <p>For example, in AI, the latest digital human technology, through synthetic voice, emotion, visual image and three-dimensional graphic modeling. As much as this may benefit digital enterprises from one perspective, it can also be a disadvantage in other perspectives, as it can be used by malicious actors to formulate new types of cyber-attacks. Having background in cyber related crime, I have often seen these new types of attacks, which use AI generated synthetic imaging and videos to represent an individual who has a reputable position within a company, to falsely advertise a campaign, in hopes that their ‘audience’ fall for the scam, which unfortunately often lead to monetary losses.</p>
                    <p>I also agree with your views on improvements needed surrounding the energy crisis, and the topic in general. The use of fossil fuels is not sustainable which has shown over the decades in environmental damages which have affected us in some ways as well. The energy crisis leaves behind important lessons regarding the energy transition. One important lesson we learn from the crisis is that the energy transition process will have disruptive effects through supply shocks, rising energy demand and rising prices. Policy makers need to find a way to make the energy transition less painful by ensuring that there are enough energy reserves in order to meet energy demand during transition process. Future studies and implementations of new technologies can perhaps help this long term issue the world has been facing.</p>
