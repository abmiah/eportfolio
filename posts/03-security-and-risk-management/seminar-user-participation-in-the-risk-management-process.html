                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>For this Seminar, students are required to read a publication from Spears &amp; Barki (2010). The article proposes incorporating quantitative and qualitative research techniques to achieve a more extensive comprehension of regulatory compliance. By utilising both methods, one can obtain factual and dependable data on outcomes and gain insight into the process through participants&apos; perspectives. The article recommends measures that must be taken to ensure effective integration, such as refining paradigms, obtaining funding for both perspectives, training researchers in both methods and promoting mutual acceptance and respect between quantitative and qualitative researchers.</p>
                <p>The publication that students had the opportunity to peruse was rather intricate, as it provided a comprehensive analysis of qualitative and quantitative assessment, which not only elucidated the root causes of breaches but also suggested practical ways to mitigate these risks. One of the recommended strategies to minimise these risks is to provide appropriate training to the staff. It is imperative to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative assessment to apprehend the publication fully.</p>
                <p><strong>What is Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Qualitative Assessment:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Depiction:</strong> Qualitative assessment uses observation, surveys, consultations, focus groups, and interviews to provide descriptive insights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It assists in comprehending the reasons behind behaviours, motivations, and emotions by analysing text-based information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common qualitative assessment methods include observing employees, conducting self-report surveys, consulting with experts, and using focus groups.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Quantitative Assessment:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Depiction:</strong> Quantitative assessment involves collecting numerical data through pre-existing records, testing, and structured surveys for statistical analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It emphasises quantifying variables, drawing general conclusions, and providing objective findings based on numeric data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Gathering statistics from pre-existing records, conducting tests, and using structured surveys with numerical data are typical quantitative assessment approaches.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quantitative Data:</strong> This refers to information that can be counted or measured and is expressed through numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Qualitative Data:</strong> This text describes information expressed in language and requires interpretation. It is descriptive.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Qualitative and quantitative methods complement each other and provide valuable insights into workplace dynamics, student outcomes, or research findings (fullstory, 2021; Coleman, n.d.; Survey Monkey, 2018; Grand Canyon University, 2023).</p>
                <p><span style="background:yellow;">Read the Spears &amp; Barki (2010) article then prepare answers to the following questions:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="background:yellow;">How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The study utilised a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessment techniques. Qualitative methodologies were utilised to depict scenarios, offer recommendations for intervention strategies, and comprehend behaviours through observation, self-report surveys, and expert consultations. In contrast, quantitative methods were employed for expeditious administration, simplified evaluation, and generating more precise, objective outcomes. The quantitative techniques included pre-existing records, focus groups, one-on-one interviews, surveys, and testing (Spears &amp; Barki, 2010; (SAMHSA, 2022).</p>
                <p>Using qualitative research methods offers a distinct advantage in obtaining more comprehensive insights into assessment and testing design, administration, and interpretation and exploring test-takers&apos; behaviour and perceptions. This approach allows researchers to understand phenomena and participants&apos; perspectives better. However, qualitative methods have limitations, including smaller sample sizes and a more time-consuming process.</p>
                <p>In contrast, quantitative research offers benefits such as larger sample sizes, faster data collection, and more precise results. However, they have faced criticism for providing only brief snapshots of phenomena without delving into the in-depth experiences and meanings behind them (Rahman, 2020).</p>
                <p><span style="background:yellow;">What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?</span></p>
                <p>The authors list the advantages of involving users in the risk management process.:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a higher level of risk awareness across the entire organisation.</li>
                    <li>Organisational objectives and goals can be approached with more confidence when risk is considered and factored into the strategy.</li>
                    <li>Improved and more effective adherence to both external regulatory requirements and internal guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Improve operational efficiency by consistently applying risk management processes and controls.</li>
                    <li>It has improved safety and security measures for employees and customers.</li>
                    <li>We have a competitive edge in the marketplace.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Spears &amp; Barki, 2010; Tucci &amp; Stedman, 2023)</p>
                <p><span style="background:yellow;">Based on the findings of the research,</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="background:yellow;">How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The risk assessment process, particularly in the context of Identity and Access Management (IAM) risk assessments, can be significantly impacted by inadequate user access control. The failure to implement proper user access controls can lead to the persistence of access to sensitive information and intellectual property by unauthorised individuals or former employees, thereby posing a severe security risk. Weak identity management practices can result in unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential safety-related consequences, thus underscoring the criticality of sound IAM policy. Furthermore, deficient access management and suboptimal authentication methods can further magnify the overall risk exposure, necessitating a comprehensive risk assessment process that accounts for all relevant IAM factors (Spears &amp; Barki, 2010; &nbsp;(Pettersen, 2023; Team Zluri, 2024; Mutabazi, 2021).</p>
                <p><span style="background:yellow;">Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?</span></p>
                <p>The present article critically evaluates and compares the advantages and limitations of qualitative and quantitative methods in language testing and assessment research. Qualitative techniques, such as observation, self-report surveys, and expert consultations, are renowned for offering in-depth insights into human behaviours, perceptions, and intervention approaches. Conversely, quantitative methods, including pre-existing records, focus groups, one-on-one interviews, surveys, and drug testing, provide quicker administration and more transparent, more objective results. While qualitative research allows for a deeper understanding of phenomena, quantitative research focuses on larger sample sizes and faster data collection. Still, it may need more in-depth exploration of the former (Spears &amp; Barki, 2010; (SAMHSA, 2022).</p>
                <p><span style="background:yellow;">How might you mitigate any issues encountered?</span></p>
                <p>To tackle the challenges in language testing, seeking insights from a diverse group of experts can offer a broader range of perspectives. Additionally, providing comprehensive observation training to supervisors can improve the quality of data collection.&nbsp;(SAMHSA, 2022)</p>
                <p>When utilising quantitative techniques, it is crucial to construct meticulous self-report questionnaires to ensure impartiality and precision. While opting for drug testing, it is advisable to contemplate expenses and lawful obligations before putting this method into practice. By judiciously combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches, researchers can overcome the limitations of each technique and strengthen the overall robustness of their assessment processes.</p>
                <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
                <p>Spears &amp; Barki (2010) suggested including qualitative and quantitative research approaches to understand regulatory compliance comprehensively. To achieve this, they proposed refining research paradigms, securing funding, training researchers in both methods and promoting mutual acceptance and respect between quantitative and qualitative researchers. The publication provides an in-depth analysis of qualitative and quantitative assessments, underlining their differences and how they complement each other to provide valuable insights into workplace dynamics, student outcomes, or research findings.</p>
