            <article>
                <p>The Common Vulnerability System (CVSS) is a widely recognised framework organisations use to identify software security weaknesses. It has earned recognition from the US government's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the payment card industries. The system is maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) (First.org, 2019; Spring et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>CVSS utilises a rating system from 0 to 10 to determine the severity of vulnerabilities. These scores range from low to critical, with 0 indicating the least severe vulnerability and 10 indicating the most critical. These scores are beneficial for organisations as they evaluate software vulnerabilities according to their severity (First.org, 2019; Risto, 2023; Spring et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>According to Spring et al. (2021) states that the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for risk scoring is not a reliable approach. Despite the lack of transparency in the justification for the formula used to calculate the base score of CVSS v3.0, some governmental agencies still recommend its use. Organisations must provide their responses to eight questions on a 0 to 10 scale to determine their CVSS score. Spring et al. (2021) argue that the CVSS documentation alone does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that this method is rigorous and solely designed to identify technical vulnerabilities. It fails to consider the associated risks and the necessary response methods, making it an insufficient approach.</p>
                <p>Spring et al. (2021) have raised concerns regarding the usability and practicality of CVSS. To address these issues, the researchers suggest employing Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) as an alternative. SSVC provides an open GitHub repository that facilitates community contribution and allows for the identification of the specific needs and expectations of various user groups regarding CVSS.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the numerical scoring system of CVSS, the SSVC employs a concept similar to an attack tree diagram to represent the various possibilities of potential failure visually. The attack tree diagram is a comprehensive framework for analysing how a system could be compromised or attacked (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2023). Although the paper by Spring et al. (2019) on SSVC is still theoretical, it simplifies the decision-making process for verifying vulnerabilities based on assumptions rather than attacks.</p>

                    <p><em>by Mohammed Younes - Tuesday, 6 February 2024, 11:16 AM</em></p>
                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your insightful overview of the Industrial Revolution and its transition to the current era of Industry 4.0. Indeed AI, machine learning and other digital technologies have played a transformative role in the industry 4.0 which raised risks as highlighted by (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019).</p>
                    <p>For example, competence risks and the need of new skills and competencies in industry 4.0; Kazançoglu and Özkan Özen (2018) argue that it will be vital to establish new criteria to hire and evaluate the human workforce. Moreover, Hecklau et al (2016) highlight the scarcity of qualified workers to meet the industry 4.0 challenges, which makes it a critical factor in the process of adjusting businesses to the industry 4.0 landscape, thus executives and recruiters now seek innovative behavior, critical thinking, knowledge and adaptation to technology during the recruitment and screening of applicants during the hiring processes.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I agree with your comment regarding the danger of cyber threats and cybercriminals exploiting potential system vulnerabilities in the context of new evolving technologies. The technological advancements and associated risks in the realm of Industry 4.0 really provides a thought-provoking perspective on the intricate interplay between innovation and security. Hence, it would be important to have proactive risk management strategies in place for businesses to survive in this rapidly changing landscape.</p>
