                <p>The Common Vulnerability System (CVSS) is a widely recognised framework organisations use to identify software security weaknesses. It has earned recognition from the US government's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the payment card industries. The system is maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) (First.org, 2019; Spring et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>CVSS utilises a rating system from 0 to 10 to determine the severity of vulnerabilities. These scores range from low to critical, with 0 indicating the least severe vulnerability and 10 indicating the most critical. These scores are beneficial for organisations as they evaluate software vulnerabilities according to their severity (First.org, 2019; Risto, 2023; Spring et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>According to Spring et al. (2021) states that the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for risk scoring is not a reliable approach. Despite the lack of transparency in the justification for the formula used to calculate the base score of CVSS v3.0, some governmental agencies still recommend its use. Organisations must provide their responses to eight questions on a 0 to 10 scale to determine their CVSS score. Spring et al. (2021) argue that the CVSS documentation alone does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that this method is rigorous and solely designed to identify technical vulnerabilities. It fails to consider the associated risks and the necessary response methods, making it an insufficient approach.</p>
                <p>Spring et al. (2021) have raised concerns regarding the usability and practicality of CVSS. To address these issues, the researchers suggest employing Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) as an alternative. SSVC provides an open GitHub repository that facilitates community contribution and allows for the identification of the specific needs and expectations of various user groups regarding CVSS.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the numerical scoring system of CVSS, the SSVC employs a concept similar to an attack tree diagram to represent the various possibilities of potential failure visually. The attack tree diagram is a comprehensive framework for analysing how a system could be compromised or attacked (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2023). Although the paper by Spring et al. (2019) on SSVC is still theoretical, it simplifies the decision-making process for verifying vulnerabilities based on assumptions rather than attacks.</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>I agree with the CVSS rating and findings provided by Spring et al (2021), but as a risk threat guideline and used in ERM, I would still use CVSS. Mainly because it is established, and many other well-known organizations recognized the validity of their findings. Of course, all findings need to be reviewed in the context of the environment being assessed. </p>
                    <p>The facts on how the CVSS rating are calculated may be disputed but the methods and formulas are freely available on the CVSS paper by Mel, P (2007). This paper discusses the three metric groups used and how each aspect is formulated. This method is a lot easier to use in a risk assessment than SVCC, which requires a cost benefit analysis to be completed for each vulnerability being assessed and may not be scalable to large corporates. </p>
                    <p>Yes, CVSS may have its flaws, but many other risk rating options may also have flaws such as SVCC which is still in development. We also cannot put full reliance on these vulnerabilities and ratings, for example the Solar Winds attack bypassed all controls and infiltrated the audit process ( S.Oladimeji. 2023), which vulnerability ratings of any known solution would not have picked up. </p>
                    <p>I would therefore still use CVSS for threat vulnerability management within context of the environment being assessed and risk appetite of the business. </p>

                    <p><em>by Mohammed Younes - Wednesday, 27 March 2024, 7:06 AM</em></p>
                    <p>The discussion surrounding the efficacy of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) versus the proposed Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) raises several critical points that warrant careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, it's undeniable that CVSS has become widely recognized and adopted by organizations, including governmental agencies and industries like payment card companies. Its endorsement by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and maintenance by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) lend it a significant level of credibility. The simplicity of its rating system, ranging from 0 to 10, also provides organizations with a straightforward means of assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. However, the concerns raised by Spring et al. (2021) regarding the transparency and reliability of CVSS cannot be dismissed lightly. The lack of clarity in the justification for the formula used to calculate CVSS scores undermines confidence in its accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the argument that CVSS may not adequately consider associated risks and appropriate response methods highlights potential limitations in its effectiveness for comprehensive vulnerability management. On the other hand, the proposal of SSVC as an alternative approach introduces intriguing possibilities. By shifting from a numerical scoring system to a visual representation akin to an attack tree diagram, SSVC aims to provide a more holistic understanding of vulnerabilities and their potential impact. This approach aligns with principles of risk analysis and allows for the consideration of various factors beyond just severity.</p>
                    <p>In summary, while CVSS has enjoyed widespread adoption and recognition, valid concerns exist regarding its transparency and effectiveness in vulnerability assessment. The proposal of SSVC offers a compelling alternative that emphasizes a more nuanced understanding of vulnerabilities. However, further research and practical testing are necessary to determine its viability and effectiveness as a replacement or complementary approach to CVSS. Ultimately, the choice between CVSS and SSVC should be informed by the specific needs and capabilities of individual organizations in managing their cybersecurity risks.</p>
