            <article>
                <p><b>1. Introduction </b></br> The third module of our MSc Cybersecurity program, led by Dr. Siddiqui, was a deep dive into <b>Security and Risk Management.</b> Students learnt about risk assessment techniques and explored their practical application in real-world scenarios. For instance, we delved into qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques like STRIDE and examined emerging trends, like hybrid modules, directly applicable to real-world cybersecurity scenarios.</p>
                <p> Effective cybersecurity is not just a requirement but a critical requirement for all organisations. It is not sufficient to implement security measures once and then disregard them. These need continuous security and risk management measures to safeguard against malicious threats. These practices also ensure preparedness for emerging risks (IBM, 2023).</p>
                <p> As a twelve-week module that required active engagement through readings, activities, and seminars, I decided to maintain a log of all my events, a mini journal. This active learning approach not only aided in recapping the module but also ensured that I constantly applied the knowledge gained in real-time, a lesson learned from the previous module, <b>Network Security,</b> with Dr Khan. This personal growth and learning experience, which I consider invaluable, has significantly enhanced my understanding of the subject matter and my overall development in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
                <p><b> 2. Overview of the course and various activities:</b></p>
                <p><b> 2.2. Seminars</b></br> During our initial session, Dr. Siddique shared an overview of the prerequisites for the course and recounted his academic journey in cybersecurity. His personal experiences, challenges, and opportunities were both enlightening and inspiring. Dr. Siddique also noted that cybersecurity students typically have a varied understanding of IT, computer science or similar. Having a graphic design background, I felt a sense of ease knowing that Dr. Siddique also began his journey in the same field. His guidance, for which I am deeply grateful, proved extremely valuable for individuals pursuing education beyond the MSc programme and has been instrumental in my learning journey.</p>
                <p> During the seminar, the significance of e-portfolios during one’s learning was emphasised. Subsequently, I manually updated my e-portfolio writing HTML; converting Word to HTML using online tools was challenging, as it involved dealing with additional tags and paywalls. Nevertheless, this exercise proved to be a valuable learning experience, as it helped me to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, referencing from W3C and other reputable sources. This practice allowed me to categorise the contents of each module, facilitating better organisation and management.</p>
                <p> The twelve units also included six seminars, excluding the introductory session, which, if discussed in detail, would exceed the word count allotted for this reflection piece. Students were required to read specific extracts and answer questions before attending the seminars, reflecting on their knowledge and personal development. The seminars encompassed the following topics, which are linked to my e-portfolio:</p>

                </ol>
                <p> Students engaged in an open discussion about the subject during each seminar. These conversations involved sharing personal experiences and insights, which allowed us to delve into areas of interest and ask general questions about the course. After the presentations, the Professor elaborated on the subject matter and recommended that students seek supplementary information. Notably, the level of attendance from fellow peers could have been higher. Whilst the seminars were not entirely compulsory, the same individuals were consistently present, and in one instance, attendance was limited to only me, which did feel rather demoralising. </p>
                <p> Nevertheless, each seminar gave students invaluable insight into each unit and our assignments. As a diligent participant in the workshop, I have attempted to make meaningful contributions by meticulously completing all the requisite tasks and presenting them to both the professor and my fellow peers. This dedication to the course is something I intend to continue throughout the course, and I hope it inspires others to do the same. </p>
                <p> The <b>User Participation in Risk Management Process</b> seminar was rather intriguing due to the complexity of the paper. Students were tasked with analysing the publication by Spears & Barki (2010) titled <b>User Participation in Information Systems Security Risk Management.</b> This scholarly article required multiple readings and further research into both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. The exercise, though challenging, was an enriching learning experience that highlighted the importance of consistently pursuing authoritative sources of information and examining the authors' sources for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
                <p> The paper discusses integrating quantitative and qualitative research methods to provide a more complete understanding of regulatory compliance through a multi-method study at an organisational level. It highlights that while quantitative research generates factual and reliable outcome data, qualitative research provides rich, detailed process data based on participants' perspectives. By combining both approaches, researchers can achieve a more comprehensive understanding that neither method can provide.<a href="https://abmiah.github.io/eportfolio/posts/03-security-and-risk-management/seminar-user-participation-in-the-risk-management-process.html" target="_blank"> Read User Participation in the Risk Management Process.</a></p>
                <p><b>2.3. Discussion Forum</b></br> Students were required to partake in two discussion forums, which lasted for three weeks; in the third week, students were required to summarise their discussion. The first discussion was on Industry 4.0, and the other was on CVSS. In the first forum discussion, students were asked to analyse a scholarly article by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) titled <b>Risks of Digitalization of Business Models.</b> Our key objective was to comprehend the concept of Industry 4.0, a new form of the Industrial Revolution that has gained popularity in modern academia. While the Industrial Revolution brought remarkable technological feats and advancements propelling our society forward, it also significantly impacted our environment. In contrast, Industry 4.0 leverages cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analysis, synthesised into the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The crux of the discussion was centred on identifying potential hazards associated with Industry 4.0 and citing two examples of this risk category.</p>
                <p> I delve into the impact of the Industrial Revolution and its origins and Industry 4.0, which introduces new vulnerabilities to cybercrime. This emphasises the crucial role of data security in today's digital era. Two of my peers, <a href="https://my23007.github.io/" target="_blank">Mohammed Younis</a> and <a href="https://anja-kosar.github.io/" target="_blank">Anja Kosar,</a> provided further evidence that the new digital landscape has become more vulnerable to increasingly advanced cybersecurity attacks; Kosar (2024), however, pointed out that in 2019, a software malfunction at Knights Capital Group resulted in a loss of $440 million, this highlights software production having a lack of security implemented during its development stage. This incident emphasises the significance of evaluating risks, as the authors highlighted in their paper. I have encountered diverse interpretations of the subject through interactions with various forums and peers. I am confident that these forums will continue throughout the course to foster a culture of active participation and engagement. <a href="https://abmiah.github.io/eportfolio/posts/03-security-and-risk-management/initial-post1-discussion-feb2024.html" target="_blank">Read the initial discussion of Industry 4.0.</a></p>
                <p><b>2.4. Assignment </b></br> As part of our Unit 6 assignment, our professor divided students into two groups to undertake a comprehensive investigation of a fictitious conglomerate named Pampered Pets. The primary objective of this exercise was to identify potential risks that may arise as the organisation expands its operations into the digital sphere, explores a global supply chain to serve its diverse customer base, and experiments with alternative materials to produce its products. As a result, a critical analysis of the associated risks was deemed necessary, and we worked collaboratively to deliver insightful findings.</p>
                <p> My colleagues and I engage in routine Zoom meetings to deliberate and carry out a prescribed set of actions. We have undertaken multiple risk assessment methodologies, primarily focusing on the FAIR and OCTAVE-S paradigms previously explained during seminars and lectures.</p>
                <p> The diligent team tirelessly compiled research for a comprehensive report. However, due to the sheer volume of information, we enlisted two capable editors to transform the information into a refined and concise 1000-word report. This was a challenging feat, as they needed to prioritise the key objectives and challenges of the business over theoretical information. The decision to have only two editors ensured the report would maintain a consistent tone and writing style. The entire team oversaw the report and provided comments. The team scrutinised the comprehensive report and provided feedback to enhance its quality. The report included several diagrams depicting their strategic thinking and risk assessments to understand the company's present and future structure. Collaborating with my colleagues was a thrilling experience, completely free of pressure. Although the members of our group were regular attendees of most seminars, they actively engaged in discussions and were highly interactive. Additionally, they were experienced professionals in their respective fields, which resulted in a highly efficient team.</p>
                <p><b>2.5. Final assessment:</b></br> Students undertook an individual extension of the previous group project for the final assignment. The task stipulated that the owner of Pampered Pets has decided to undertake a digital transformation of their business while still retaining their physical presence and simultaneously pursuing a global supply chain. Our primary objective was to conduct a quantitative risk analysis to evaluate the potential impact of a global supply chain on the business and meet the demands of selling to the global market. In my report, I employed the Monte Carlo Simulation, a well-established mathematical model that utilises random number generation to predict probabilities and effectively manage risks. This approach increases accuracy and comprehensively understanding of any event's potential outcomes.</p>
                <p> The assignment also required investigating the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR), emphasising mitigating the potential threats arising from cyber incidents. The primary aim was to ensure the continuity of business operations while minimising any disruption that may occur.</p>
                <p> The task at hand was not without its challenges, particularly in the realm of executing the Monte Carlo Simulation. After perusing the literature on our module reading list, I turned to online resources, specifically YouTube, to elucidate the process and gain a more comprehensive understanding. Incidentally, the initial video that I happened upon expounded upon the undertaking via the utilisation of Python and Matplotlib library, providing a sound methodology for the simulation's implementation.</p>
                <p> Applying the Python method to the simulation yielded a few issues. The installation of Matplotlib on the Codio platform encountered several problems, and it did not load correctly. PyCharm IDE was used as an alternative, and while the initial part of the code went well, the need to repeatedly refer to matplotlib.org to compile the graph, coupled with the time-consuming and somewhat frustrating nature of the Matplotlib tutorials, posed a challenge. Furthermore, due to the assignment's strict deadline, it was necessary to use Microsoft Excel, as detailed in the reading material, to run the simulation.</p>
                <p> I followed yet another YouTube tutorial on Monte Carlo Simulation using Microsoft Excel. The tutorial gave me the requisite formulas to compile a comprehensive risk assessment for a global supply chain. However, I had to categorise the scenarios into two distinct groups. The first group was predicated on external factors, such as natural disasters, while the second group centred on economic factors, such as cyber threats and global political risks.</p>
                <p> The simulation exercise, which entailed enumerating a range of 1000 probabilities, initially presented challenges and frustrations. However, it subsequently proved a valuable learning experience, as it brought to light the possibility of a particular event occurring. My research findings indicated that earthquakes are the foremost contributors to natural disasters, while cyber threats are the primary contributors to economic factors. This emphasises the potential risks of a global supply chain and the imperative for measures to mitigate such threats.</p>
                <p> Students were also required to explore the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR), representing two distinct yet crucial concepts for organisations to maintain seamless operations during an incident. This plan should have a backup system, data recovery procedures, and mitigation strategies for any disruptions. Failure would have severe consequences for the organisation and all its stakeholders.</p>
                <p> The project requirements for the disaster recovery plan were obvious. The plan needed to ensure that the digital store was available 24/7/365 and that the recovery time during a disaster was less than one minute. However, to avoid being locked into a single vendor, a hybrid solution was proposed, advising using multiple vendors and add-ons from various cloud providers to customise the disaster recovery solution and avoid vendor lock-in issues.</p>
                <p> In my report, I discussed using Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) and a hybrid solution. Disaster recovery is a vast and vital topic for any organisation to implement for its survival during an incident that can affect its operation. Although DR was covered during the course, the topic requires more intensive research and understanding, as several vendors provide DR solutions. Ultimately, a hybrid solution is what most organisations should aim for, and finding a solution capable of covering all organisation's needs would require continuous research. <a href="https://abmiah.github.io/eportfolio/posts/03-security-and-risk-management/individual-project-executive-summary.html" target="_blank">Read Individual Project: Executive Summary.</a></p>
                <p><b>3. Further Learning:</b></br> My academic pursuits extend beyond the confines of this module. As someone with an insatiable appetite for knowledge, I am resolute in expanding my understanding of the subjects covered in this module. This knowledge will prove invaluable in my professional trajectory. I have identified a specific area of interest, which I intend to investigate further to enhance my personal growth and development.</p>
