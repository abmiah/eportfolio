                    <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>

                    <p> Hi there. Thank you for taking the time to view my presentation. I am currently pursuing my MSc in Cyber Security at the University of Essex online. <b>Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law</b> is the sixth module of this program, and this unit assignment focused on a case study of EncroChat.</p>

                    <p> The presentation will explore what EncroChat is, who uses this product, and the legal aspects of EncroChat.</p>

                    <p><b>2. What is EncroChat, and what exactly does it do?</b></p>

                    <p> EncroChat is a robust, encrypted communication platform. It is typically installed on customised Android mobile devices such as the BQ Aquaris XS, manufactured by a Spanish electronics company and advertised as EncroPhones to its customers. EncroChat is highly sought after for its encrypted communication capabilities and is noted as one of the most comprehensive encryption communication services, allowing its users to make calls, send messages from the EncroChat private messaging app, and even write notes, all of which are encrypted. It reportedly serves a user base of approximately 60,000 individuals, 10,000 of which are located within the United Kingdom, to facilitate secure communication (Cyfor.co.uk, 2020; Harewood Law, 2020; Richards, 2020; Sky News, 2020). </p>
                    <p> In simpler terms, EncroChat is a highly secure version of WhatsApp or Telegram, with additional features such as the ability to wipe all data from the device that has selectively removed hardware components like the camera and microphone.</p>
                    <p> Some of the key features of EncroChat are as follows:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> End-to-end security and encrypted communication </li>
                            <li> Ability to wipe out the entire content on the phone immediately</li>
                            <li> The removal of specific hardware, including camera, GPS and microphone. </li>
                            <li> A ‘Kill Pill’ feature that has the ability for the phone to self-destruct its content.</li>
                            <li> The device operated using Wi-Fi, avoiding phone networks.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>(Cyfor.co.uk, 2020; Richards, 2020; Harewood Law, 2020)</p>

                    <p><b>3. Who is responsible for EncroChat?</b></p>

                    <p> According to Sky News (2020), reports from The National Crime Agency the (NCA) state that the creators and managers of EncroChat remain unknown. According to Newton Law (2022b), not to be confused with Sir Isaac Newton, the individual, reports indicate it was a Dutch company that operated in France in 2016; further supported by NL Times (2024), which states that three men of Dutch origins were arrested in June 2022 and were the main protagonist on the sale of EncroChat devices making an allegedly 56 million Euros. However, they only sold the devices in the Netherlands; whether they are the owners is questionable. However, reports have identified that EncroChat’s servers are located in France, implying that the company responsible may be situated within the European Union, including the UK (Cyfor.co.uk, 2020). </p>

                    <p> This raises legal questions about jurisdiction and responsibility, which we will explore further in the next slide. </p>

                    <p><b>4. What are the regulations for using servers within the EU?</b> </p>

                    <p> In this section, I want to quickly cover some EU regulations regarding whether data localisation may be required for EncroChat servers since they are located in.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>EU Regulation.</b>
                                <p> According to French regulations, data storage and handling must be conducted using cloud-based services within the European Union. This requirement upholds data sovereignty, mandating that service administrators to be located within the EU (Cory, 2021).</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>GDPR.</b>
                                <p> Within the European Union, organisations are obligated to adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This necessitates secure storage of data and grants individuals the right to access their data in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL), the French data protection authority (Cissé, 2022; Europa.eu, 2024). </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b> Non-Personal Data.</b>
                                <p> Data that cannot be attributed to a specific individual may be stored in the European Union. This implies that non-personal data, which cannot be linked to an identifiable person, may be hosted on servers within the EU without the requirement for physical presence in an EU member state (Europa.eu, 2024).</p>
                            </li>

                        </ol>

                    <p> As EncroChat’s business activity is a secure messaging service, the company may fall into the category of non-personal data because EncroChat users cannot be supposedly identified. The location of the company itself will be discussed in the next slide.</p>

                    <p><b> 5. Who owns EncroChat, and is it illegal?</b></p>

                    <p> The argument of who still owns EncroChat is still being debated; statements indicate that a Canadian citizen, Mr Paul Krusky, was the central figure in its creation; according to a French newspaper, Le Parisien, Mr Krusky was the administrator of EncroChat and was developed by Mr Krusky in 2013 (Goinard, 2022).</p>

                    <p> Mr Krusky was arrested in 2022 in the Dominican Republic, where he lived with his wife in a private gated community on the island; he was at a local restaurant at the time of his arrest, and soon after, he was extradited to France to face various criminal charges which include alleged involvement of money laundering, drug trafficking, aiding criminal organisation with their illicit activity, firearm position and also providing the encrypted devices, this is something, in which Mr Krusky denies, according to his lawyer, Mr Antonie Vey, a criminal lawyer based in France who has also represented the likes of Julian Assange during his extradition case to the US (Castaldo and Posadzki, 2024; García and Goodwin, 2022).</p>

                    <p> According to Castaldo and Posadzki (2024), a company that went by the name of EsoCrypt Panama SA was first registered in November 2014 in Panama. A few months later, the company changed its name to EncroChat. However, reports show that another company, EncroChat Ltd, was registered in Hong Kong in 2015 with Mr Krusky as its only director. The company was then sold, but Mr Krusky did not disclose any details regarding the new owners; however, according to Cox (2021), the co-owners of EncroChat have a shell company in Panama with an international banking account for fund transfers.</p>

                    <p><b> 6. The question that arises is whether or not the use of EncroChat is legal. </b></p>

                    <p> According to Harewood Law (2020), the use of EncroChat itself is not illegal. Newton Law (2022a) also states that having or owning an EncroPhone is not considered illegal. Celebrities and high-net-worth individuals are known to be users, as secrecy is paramount (Cyfor.co.uk, 2020). However, the use of EncroChat by criminals to conduct their illicit activities raised questions about its efficacy. Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs) were able to discuss their operations with complete anonymity and with impunity from the law. This was not the intention of Mr Krusky, who stated that he had only created such a technology to respect users' privacy and not to aid criminals (Castaldo and Posadzki, 2024).</p>

                    <p><b> 7. How are criminals utilising EncroChat for their illicit activity?</b></p>

                    <p> In 2020, a joint operation by French and Dutch forces infiltrated EncroChat servers with malware, revealing over 100 million previously encrypted messages from various criminal groups. This has led to over 6,000 international arrests, with 2,800 in the UK alone (Burgess, 2023; Europol, 2023; Newton Law, 2022a). </p>

                    <p> With the hacking of EncroChat, law enforcement agencies around the world were able to prevent criminal activity and seize several assets. The following data illustrates how criminals using EncroChat were successful in their operations.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In total, there were 6,658 arrests. </li>
                            <li>With 900 million euros, either seized or frozen.</li>
                            <li>270.2 tons of drugs were seized.</li>
                            <li>971 cars.</li>
                            <li>271 properties.</li>
                            <li>923 firearms. </li>
                            <li>89 boats. </li>
                            <li> And 40 private planes.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>(Europol, 2023)</p>

                    <p> With the seizure of various assets, these OCGs committed a wide range of crimes, from drug dealing to money laundering to murder. The following data highlights the type of criminal activity committed while using the EncroChat services.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>33.29% of criminal gangs using EncroChat for drug trafficking </li>
                            <li> Whilst 34.8 is used for organised crime </li>
                            <li>14% of EncroChat was used for money laundering</li>
                            <li>11.46% is used to carry out murders</li>
                            <li> And 6.45% is used for trafficking firearms </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>(Europol, 2023)</p>

                    <p> In the next few slides, I will discuss the potential use of EncroChat by OCGs for communication in cybercrime activities.</p>

                    <p><b> 8. The scenario in which EncroChat could be used for a cybercrime</b></p>

                    <p> According to Essex Police (2024), an organised drug gang based in Essex, here in the UK, was arrested with several others either waiting for trial or to be sentenced; the gang had allegedly used EncroChat for their illegal activity.  </p>

                    <p> Based on the information provided by the Essex Police, there is a possibility that the same criminal gang could potentially operate online, selling illegal narcotics on the dark web and communicating with organisation members to discuss their tactics and expand into cybercrime. Tropina (2010) states that criminal groups are expanding into the digital sphere due to the lower risk and the potential for high returns. The use of encrypted devices, such as an EncroPhone, can allow OCGs to communicate with members for various purposes. These may include planning distribution, replenishing stock levels, discussing fund transfers, expanding their operations, and even coordinating violent acts. However, according to BBC News (2011), gang violence to gain or protect territories has reduced significantly since transactions are done online without the physical presence of buyer and seller interaction. All these communications can occur on devices that cannot be intercepted by local law enforcement.</p>

                    <p><b> 9. Ways in which law enforcement can possibly address cyber criminals using EncroChat.</b></p>

                    <p> The hacking of EncroChat by the French and Dutch authorities was then passed onto the Metropolitan Police, whereby Driss Hayoukane from the Divisional of Criminal Investigation (DCI) set up Operation Eternal with a team of individuals tasked with analysing the compromised messages from alleged criminals using EncroChat. The investigation also revealed corrupt undercover police officers involved with criminal gangs (BBC News, 2023; Goodwin, 2024). </p>

                    <p> According to Jessup (2024), during the COVID pandemic, many criminals using EncroChat whilst confined to their homes revealed many personal details, such as family situations and photographs of themselves. </p>

                    <p> Based on this information, law enforcement (e.g., the Metropolitan Police) can analyse the messages of the Essex drug gang to identify if they have revealed any personal information. This could include the names of OCG members and the location of possible supply pick-ups or deliveries. Additionally, they can determine if the OCGs have provided any photos of themselves, family members or the location of their operation, their supply, money, and possible firearms, which could help the police to identify the OCGs, which could be used as evidence in court.</p>

                    <p> Once identified, OCG members, once in custody, can have their online activity suspended and equipment like their computers seized. Depending on the seriousness of the OCG’s activities, a specialised team, like the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) or Interpol, may be required to determine the extent of their online activity. This includes identifying whether they are in contact with other cybercriminals outside the UK's jurisdiction, if there are any ties to international cybercriminals, and the types of technology the OCGs used for their cybercrimes involving illegal drug distribution. It is important to note that the illegal drug market is found on the dark web, which can be accessed using the Tor web browser. This browser allows users to privately browse the web and avoid tracking and surveillance (Demant et al., 2019; TOR, 2019). </p>

                    <p><b>10.  Was the hacking of EncroChat legal?</b></p>

                    <p> The hacking of EncroChat is a complex issue. Many lawyers argue that the evidence of EncroChat messages presented in court is flawed and should not be used. This is partly due to concerns about data-sharing rules and the fairness of trials for those whose devices were compromised (Burgess, 2023). According to Richards (2020), the Investigation Powers Act 2016 (IPA-2016), which is a framework designed to provide oversight for law enforcement and agencies, section 56(1) from Legislation.gov.uk (2016) states that.</p>

                    <p><i>“No evidence may be adduced, question asked, assertion or disclosure made or other thing done in, for the purposes of or in connection with any legal proceedings or Inquiries Act proceedings which (in any manner)</i></p>

                    <p><i>(a) discloses, in circumstances from which its origin in interception-related conduct may be inferred”</i></p>

                    <p> This means that if the interception is done in the UK, i.e., if the monitoring of the communication has taken place within UK waters, then evidence of that communication can be used. </p>

                    <p> Judging from this legislation statement, the question is whether the actual hacking of EncroChat took place in the UK. Currently, all information points to French and Dutch authorities as the main organisers of the hack.</p>

                    <p><b>11.  Conclusion</b></p>

                    <p> EncroChat was designed to provide secure communication without the risk of third-party interception on an entirely encrypted device. This appeals to celebrities seeking privacy and high-net-worth individuals aiming to keep their business dealings confidential. The reasons for wanting a secure device are diverse, and owning such a device is not illegal. However, it is important to consider the potential for those with criminal intentions to abuse such technology, posing a threat to public safety. The legality of hacking EncroChat is a matter of ongoing debate. Organisations such as Interpol work closely with international agencies to tackle cybercrime as criminals can operate across multiple jurisdictions, making it increasingly difficult to bring them to justice. Additionally, many states have different legislation, further complicating the situation, such as the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 in the UK (Interpol, 2017; Legislation.gov.uk, 2016).</p>

                    <p> If one looks at the various media coverage of EncroChat, one will find several documentaries and news outlets discussing how law enforcement apprehended organised drug gangs. For example, there is the case of Frankie Sinclair, who evaded police for over five years and was only caught due to the use of EncroChat. Sinclair was involved in various crimes, such as drug trafficking, violent assault, and theft and openly discussed the murder of rival gang members (Parr, 2024). Another case involved a violent gang known as the Huyton Firm, which was run by two secretive brothers. They organised violent acts and murders of rival gang members in relation to an alleged cocaine theft. The gang operated for over 30 years and terrorized Merseyside in Liverpool. They were only brought down by their open discussion of violent acts on EncroChat. The brothers have allegedly been involved in organised murders, resulting in the death of a nine-year-old girl who was caught in the crossfire of a gang shooting (BBC Panorama, 2024a; BBC Panorama, 2024b). The example provided in this presentation is just one of many that demonstrates how the use of EncroChat by OCGs raises significant concerns for public safety. The example of the Huyton Firm highlights how innocent victims can get caught in the crossfire.</p>

                    <p><b>12. Thank you</b></p>

                    <p> We have now reached the end of the presentation, and I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to review my presentation on EncroChat.</p>
