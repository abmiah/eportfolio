                <p> According to Hrw.org (2021), the organisation has articulated concerns regarding global cybercrime and its implications for human rights. Additionally, it has underscored the potential hazards of a worldwide cybercrime treaty and has identified shortcomings in national cybercrime legislation.</p>
                <p> In this discussion, one will solely focus on the impact of human rights and privacy data. According to Hrw.org (2021), numerous states have enacted legislation to address cybercrime. However, these laws also prosecute non-threatening individuals such as political dissidents, journalists, lawyers, and artists. </p>
                <p> The Pakistani government has extensive access to citizens' data, citing the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA) as legal grounds. According to Amnesty International (2022) states, this practice has substantially impacted freedom of expression, limiting the populace's ability to voice their opinions. The government contends that these measures are aimed at combating the dissemination of false information, commonly termed "fake news," and to address cybercrime.</p>
                <p> The eminent artist Ai Weiwei is a notable example of an individual targeted due to his opposition to the Chinese government. Ai Weiwei, along with his wife and team members, were allegedly detained on 3 April 2011 for involvement in the “Jasmine Revolution.” Subsequently, he was imprisoned, reportedly subjected to torture, and is currently residing in exile (Amnesty International, 2011; Hilden, 2024; Sky News, 2024).</p>
                <p> According to Hrw.org (2021), government agencies combatting cybercrime are mandated to operate while upholding the principles of free speech and human rights. The United States Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act of 2018 grants the government the authority to access data beyond its jurisdiction in collaboration with other countries, permitting access to data and establishing wiretaps without the necessity of informing the state partners.</p>
                <p> During the UN Security Council meeting in 2020, the discussion on preserving human rights was brought up. However, it was noted by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the exploitation of emerging technologies for cybersecurity purposes frequently results in infringements on these rights (Brown, 2020). The management of cyber threats has evolved into a global concern. It is imperative for nations to develop a comprehensive national framework and enact legislation to address threat actors without violating fundamental human rights or intercepting data of individuals who merely possess dissenting perspectives on government policies. </p>

<!--                    <p>Dear Amrol Miah</p>-->
<!--                    <p>This was a very informative review. I did not know that internet privacy policies posed a challenge in investigating and prosecuting cybercrime. According to Deora and Chudasama (2021), cybercrime is becoming prevalent due to most countries' weak regulatory frameworks, the adoption of cybercrime as a business model, and cybercriminals' continuous adoption of new technologies to evade investigation and prosecution. Bandler and Merzon (2020) pointed out that cybercrime investigation should be supported by an effective legislative framework involving law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the private sector. There is a need to ensure effective cyber evidence collection and clear attribution of cybercrime and criminal ligation (Bandler & Merzon, 2020). Sheptycki (2022) argued that there are transnational organizations of policing through institutions like the international police (INTERPOL), European Police (EUROPOL) and Africa Police (AFRIPOL). However, Sheptycki (2022) indicated that there is no uniform global system of justice that could facilitate the prosecution of transnational organized crime in the physical world or in emerging cyberspace.</p>-->
