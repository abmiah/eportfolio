                <p> According to Tropina (2010), the development of the digital sphere has profoundly transformed the modus operandi of criminals in conducting illicit activities. The allure of high returns coupled with low risk has rendered it a compelling option for various criminal organisations; furthermore, organised crime groups have the capability to operate outside the jurisdiction of a country's laws, facilitating cybercriminals' ability to target victims in one country while operating in another part of the world. Bernat and Godlove (2012) further support this, asserting that the privacy of the internet poses challenges for law enforcement investigations due to territorial boundaries, which have incentivised traditional criminals to move towards cybercrime.  </p>
                <p> Kevin Mitnick, a name that reverberates in the global hacking community, was primarily driven by curiosity rather than financial gain when he gained unauthorised access to corporations like Motorola (BBC, 2002; Hesseldahl, 2015). However, the cybercrime landscape is predominantly shaped by financial motivations. These organised cybercrimes, unlike Mitnick's solo exploits, involve the exploitation of vulnerabilities and the collaboration of criminal syndicates. This collaboration can involve thousands of individuals, leveraging the technical expertise of certain members to achieve their criminal objectives (National Crime Agency, 2019; Tropina, 2010). </p>
                <p> Efforts to address international crimes present several challenges. Organised crime may operate in countries with limited legislation to combat cybercrime, often due to insufficient funding or a lack of necessary tools, such as technical knowledge (Tropina, 2010). Organisations such as Interpol, with their extensive international reach, play a pivotal role in providing global law enforcement by closely collaborating with public and private sectors to mitigate cybercrime (Interpol, 2017).</p>

                    <p>Dear Amrol Miah</p>
                    <p>This was a very informative review. I did not know that internet privacy policies posed a challenge in investigating and prosecuting cybercrime. According to Deora and Chudasama (2021), cybercrime is becoming prevalent due to most countries' weak regulatory frameworks, the adoption of cybercrime as a business model, and cybercriminals' continuous adoption of new technologies to evade investigation and prosecution. Bandler and Merzon (2020) pointed out that cybercrime investigation should be supported by an effective legislative framework involving law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the private sector. There is a need to ensure effective cyber evidence collection and clear attribution of cybercrime and criminal ligation (Bandler & Merzon, 2020). Sheptycki (2022) argued that there are transnational organizations of policing through institutions like the international police (INTERPOL), European Police (EUROPOL) and Africa Police (AFRIPOL). However, Sheptycki (2022) indicated that there is no uniform global system of justice that could facilitate the prosecution of transnational organized crime in the physical world or in emerging cyberspace.</p>

                    <p><em>by Mohammed Younes - Saturday, 10 August 2024, 1:21 PM</em></p>
                    <p>Dear Amrol</p>
                    <p>This is an insightful analysis of how the digital sphere has transformed criminal activities, especially in the realm of cybercrime. Tropina (2010) highlighted the challenges posed by the borderless nature of the internet, which complicates law enforcement efforts due to jurisdictional issues. The shift from traditional crime to cybercrime is indeed a significant trend, driven by the low risk and high rewards that the digital environment offers.</p>
                    <p>However, while the emphasis on financial motivations in cybercrime is well-founded, it's worth noting that the motivations behind cybercrime are increasingly diverse. For instance, hacktivism, where individuals or groups use hacking to promote political ends, is another growing trend (Taylor, Fritsch, & Liederbach, 2014). This adds a layer of complexity to the cybercrime landscape, as the goals of these actors are not solely financial but also ideological.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, while Interpol and other international organizations play a crucial role in fighting cybercrime, there is an argument to be made that these efforts are sometimes hampered by geopolitical considerations. Countries may be reluctant to fully cooperate in international investigations due to concerns about sovereignty, national security, or political differences (McGuire & Dowling, 2013). This can create gaps in global law enforcement efforts, allowing some cybercriminals to exploit these weaknesses.</p>

                    <p><em>by Syed Imran Ali - Wednesday, 21 August 2024, 3:26 AM</em></p>
                    <p>Hi Amrol</p>
                    <p>you've done an excellent job of highlighting the complexities and evolving nature of cybercrime, particularly how the digital sphere has transformed traditional organized crime. I appreciate how you contrasted Kevin Mitnick's motivations with those of modern cybercriminal syndicates. Mitnick’s exploits, driven by curiosity, indeed stand in stark contrast to today’s financially motivated organized cybercrime, which often involves large networks of individuals working together to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
                    <p>Your discussion on the jurisdictional challenges faced by law enforcement when dealing with cybercrime is particularly important. The fact that organized crime can operate across borders with relative impunity due to differences in national legislation and enforcement capabilities is a significant issue. As you pointed out, the involvement of organizations like Interpol is crucial in addressing these transnational challenges. However, as you mentioned, the effectiveness of these efforts can be hampered by the lack of resources or legislation in some countries.</p>
                    <p>I would like to add that another layer of complexity is the increasing use of encrypted communications and cryptocurrencies by cybercriminals. These tools not only make it harder to track and apprehend criminals but also facilitate their operations across different jurisdictions. This emphasizes the need for international collaboration not only at the enforcement level but also in terms of policy and legislation to keep pace with technological advancements.</p>
                    <p>Overall, your post effectively captures the intricate relationship between technology, law enforcement, and organized crime, and underscores the need for continued international cooperation to address these evolving threats.</p>

                    <p>Hello Amrol</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your post, I found it to be a very interesting read. I agree with the assertion that the digital sphere has significantly transformed the modus operandi of criminals and facilitated the rise of cybercrime. The anonymity and borderless nature of cyberspace provide an ideal environment for organized crime, allowing criminals to operate from jurisdictions with weak legal frameworks, as noted by Tropina (2010) and supported by the World Bank's analysis of illicit financial flows in the digital economy.</p>
                    <p>The shift towards cybercrime is evident in the increasing prevalence of online-based criminal activities, which require minimal technical expertise. This trend has been documented in various studies, including research on the rise of online drug dealing and other illicit activities facilitated by digital platforms. (Demant, et al., 2019) Moreover, the concept of “digital criminology” emphasizes the need to understand how digital technologies intersect with crime and justice, highlighting the relevance of social structures and inequalities that persist in a digital society. (Stratton, et al., 2017)</p>
