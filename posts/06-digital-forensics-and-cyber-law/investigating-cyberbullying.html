                <p><b>What is Bullying?</b></p>
                <p> To first understand cyberbullying, one must comprehend the concept of bullying itself; according to Volk et al. (2014), the notion of bullying is a complicated area of research that has led to numerous papers on the subject. The definition itself has been cited thousands of times from Professor Dan Olweus’s book titled “Bullying in School”, which Olweus (1994) described bullying as;</p>
                <p><em>“A student is being bullied or victimized when he or she is exposed, repeatedly
                and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other students” </em></p>
                <p> This statement implies that a student may deliberately take a harmful action to cause distress or harm to someone who cannot defend themselves (Olweus, 1994). According to the Anti-Bullying Alliance (2022), bullying consists of four critical elements: being hurtful, repetitive, involving a power imbalance, and having the intention to cause harm.</p>
                <p> Professor Olweus uses the term “student”; however, according to the Cambridge Dictionary (2019), it refers to an individual studying at school, college, or university. Conversely, one must also consider that bullying is not solely restricted to “students”. According to a YouGov study by Morris (2023), 21% of UK adults have experienced bullying, with 56% occurring in the workplace, and 50% of 18 to 24-year-olds were bullied both in person and online.</p>
                <p><b> The Cause of Cyberbullying </b></p>
                <p> Cyberbullying differs slightly compared to physical alteration of bullying, as this occurs digitally and often on open community platforms whereby content can be shared and viewed by others, such as social media, messaging forums, online gaming, and mobile phones via SMS and text. These platforms can spread harmful content and misinformation about an individual, leaving them feeling shameful, angered or scared. Compared to school playground bullying, whereby a teacher can intervene to dissolve the situation, cyberbullying has no moderators and can continue to victimise individuals relentlessly and often; these cyberbullies can be anonymous, making it challenging to identify. The result of cyberbullying can impact a victim’s behaviour and mental health, possibly leading to suicidal thoughts (Bansal et al., 2024; Kaspersky, 2022; Stopbullying, 2021; UNICEF, 2024). </p>
                <p> The case of Mia Janin, a 14-year-old student, had taken her own life over alleged cyberbullying caused by other students within her school. Her content was altered to depict the 14-year-old sexually and then shared with a group of boys on Snapchat (Davies, 2024).</p>
                <p> Currently, in the UK, there is no specific legislation for cyberbullying. Cases are addressed under preexisting laws like the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 or the Malicious Communication Act 1988. (Anti-Bullying Alliance, 2024; Gibson, n.d.).</p>
                <p><b> Modus Operandi of International Cyberbullying. </b></p>
                <p> How would the UK deal with cyberbullies located outside of the UK's jurisdiction? At present, there is no international law that addresses cyberbullying; according to Murphy (2024), there have been some growing concerns for the EU to implement more decisive action to tackle online abuse with several initiatives implemented to tackle the issues, such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), Article 19 states that individual state parties ought to implement a national framework to protect children from abuse, both mental and physical including those of exploitation in nature (UNCRC, 1993).  Cybersmile.org (2013) elaborates further, suggesting that several countries, including the EU, US, Canada, and Australia, have amended their existing legislation to include online abuse. </p>
