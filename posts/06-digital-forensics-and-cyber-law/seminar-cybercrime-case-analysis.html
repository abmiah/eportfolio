                <p>For the assigned task, students were asked to visit the cps.gov.uk website, explore the content related to <b>Cybercrime Prosecution Guidance</b>, and present a brief analysis of one of the provided guidance.</p>
                <p>According to the Crown Prosecution Service (2019), there has been a concerning increase in child sexual offences and the dissemination of indecent imagery of children in the digital realm. Offenders use various tools, including social media platforms, chatrooms, and even internet-connected gaming devices, to carry out these acts.</p>
                <p>According to Gov.uk (2003), <b>Child Sexual Offences and Indecent Images of Children</b> explicitly examines <b>Rape and other offences against children under 13</b>, as outlined in section eight of the UK legislation. This section deals with <b>Causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity</b>. According to Legislation.gov.uk (2012a), this offence can only be committed if the person intentionally incites a child under the age of 13 to engage in sexual activity or incites penetration of a child aged under 13. According to Statista (2020), 78% of child pornography are aged between 3 -13 years of age, whilst only 16% of those aged between 13 â€“ 18.</p>
                <p>In terms of <b>Indecent Images of Children</b>, according to Legislation.gov.uk (2012b), the Protection of Children Act 1978 relates to indecent photography of a child unless the defendant can prove the child is over the age of 16 and at the time of the offence, they were either married or lived together as either partners or long-term family relationship.</p>
                <p>The rapid expansion of the digital sphere has empowered perpetrators to widely disseminate numerous indecent images of children, frequently in conjunction with threats or intimidation. Despite the predominance of online communication for initial contact, physical interactions are not uncommon. In these instances, perpetrators may deceive children into participating in sexual activities while covertly recording or photographing the encounters (Crown Prosecution Service, 2019).</p>
                <p>This sort of act is predominantly conducted online because of anonymity. Perpetrators use the anonymity the Internet provides to operate within hidden online platforms for their illicit gain or personal gratification. Perpetrators utilise messaging platforms and forums to disseminate their agenda to other offenders while safeguarding their anonymity. A recent case in the UK involved Huw Edwards, a well-known news presenter, who admitted to possessing 41 indecent images of children. Edwards asserted that another individual transmitted these images to him via WhatsApp. Subsequently, it was ascertained that the individual in question had a prior conviction as a paedophile (Youngs and Manning, 2024).</p>
                <p>Parents can employ various parental control measures in order to ensure the safety of their children. This can involve establishing specific schedules for their children's online activities and implementing restrictions on time spent online. Additionally, they can utilise content filtering to prevent access to apps and content deemed inappropriate for children and to block advertisements containing unsuitable material, such as those related to alcohol or gambling. Additional means of control entail the establishment of parental controls through the household Wi-Fi network. Moreover, for individual devices such as tablets and mobile phones, parents have the capability to deactivate application downloads and employ tracking mechanisms to oversee activities on their children's devices (NSPCC, 2020; Mspy.com, 2023).</p>
