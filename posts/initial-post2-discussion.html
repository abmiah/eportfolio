                <p> Most operating systems have standard built-in firewall protection, a computer network protection that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking potential threats (Anderson, 2020; Barker, 2020; cisco.com, n.d.).</p>
                <p>The first firewall was released in the early 80s and had a basic set of pre-determined rules to monitor internet traffic. As cyber threats grew, so did firewall technology, evolving to the more complex Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Application-Based firewall (Liang & Kim, 2022; cisco.com, n.d.).</p>
                <p>An example of a potential firewall threat is a trojan; users may not know the difference when they enter a site infected with the malware. Trojans themselves will sit silently on a computer and send information back to the server. A firewall will block these malicious trojans from infected networks. Nevertheless, firewalls alone cannot distinguish between harmful and legitimate based on pre-defined rules. Application-Gateway Firewalls add a layer of protection. These firewalls no longer act as walls but as a “gateway” and work by request, first being sent to the gateway before being sent to the user, preventing them from accessing the intended server. If a network does have any harmful material, the gateway will be infected first, dealing with the issue without the user being affected. The downside of using the Application-Gateway is that it can be rather costly. The gateway can reduce the traffic speed, potentially affecting the useability and efficiency (Bettany & Halsey, 2017; cisa.gov, 2023; Harford, 2012; Liang & Kim, 2022; ionos.co.uk, 2023).</p>
                <p>A sophisticated firewall does not mean an organisation is completely safe from malware attacks. Malware can enter systems through other means, like worms or an infectious USB stick. Malware can damage systems and their data; however, having robust antivirus software will mitigate those issues. The antivirus scans the computer systems to look for irregular codes to be quarantined. A good antivirus software will automatically update itself and run regular scheduled checks. However, cybercriminals are constantly inventing more creative ways to avoid detection, including writing code with no function or useability to more advanced encryption (ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.; Rosencrance, 2021; Aswal et al., 2023).</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your insights on firewalls. I agree with your arguments; however, it's important to understand the context and system we are trying to protect. Firewalls as you highlighted have advantages as well as weaknesses. Parker (2018) argues that unprotected networks are vulnerable to hackers who usually scan the internet for computer systems without basic firewall protections. However, the weakness of this approach is that it can be vulnerable to malicious attacks from the inside. (Essex, 2023)</p>
                    <p>Regarding the antivirus software, I agree with your comments. Parker (2018) argues that some of the available antivirus software can recognize potential suspicious behavior and mark it as harmful. However, the drawback here is that malicious software keeps evolving very frequently in our current digital interconnected environment. In this context, it’s almost hard for antivirus software to keep a relevant list of known viruses.</p>
