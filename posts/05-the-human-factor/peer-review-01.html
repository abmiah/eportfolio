                <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
                <p>The author's article emphasises the crucial role of human factors in cybersecurity, focusing on social engineering, user awareness, and insider threats. Social engineering leverages human psychology, while user awareness is essential for maintaining robust security. Insider threats pose a high risk due to intentional or unintentional actions, leading to breaches with ramifications for the company.</p>
                <p><b>Key points:</b></p>
                <p>The author posits that human behaviour significantly influences organisational security. These substantial effects are entirely ascribed to the human factor, as evidenced by research conducted by the CIEHF (n.d.). While the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors is a venerable institution, the author may have bolstered their argument by incorporating additional supporting research.</p>
                <p>The author's assertion that social engineering is the leading cause of network compromise is indicated by the ISACA (2022) report. The recent ISACA (2023) report supports this claim, noting a rise in such incidents. It would be advisable for the author to obtain the latest report for accurate statistics and information. In addition, the author could have bolstered the argument by incorporating supplementary supporting data or studies that offer an alternative perspective to the report's findings.</p>
                <p>The author's report is logically detailed and correctly referenced, offering an enjoyable read. Conversely, some research areas could have been further developed to provide further supporting evidence for the report.</p>

                    <p><em>by Anja Kosar - Tuesday, 2 July 2024, 3:20 AM</em></p>
                    <p>In the realm of cyber security, technological defenses are critical. However, regardless of what defenses are installed and applied, human factors often play a pivotal and critical role in the success or failure of these defenses. Human behavior, decision making, and awareness significantly influence the security of any organization. Many cyber security incidents have been attributed to human elements. (Ergonomics, N.D.) This report focuses on three critical human factors in cyber security: Social Engineering, User Awareness & Training and Insider Threats. Each factor is analyzed for its psychological underpinnings and the critical implications it carries for a local start-up company.</p>
                    <p>Social engineering, according to the ISACA’s State of Cybersecurity 2022 report, has been the leading cause of network compromise in enterprises, as well as the costliest ISACA. (N.D.) This factor exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to breach security systems. In today’s modern society, almost everyone has access to the internet, making personal data public. Attackers also have access to this data which they use to manipulate individuals by exploiting cognitive biases and emotional responses. Theories of decision-making and economics were historically based on the assumption that decision-making is rational, selfish, and stable over time. However, research in cognitive science has shown that at least two of those attributes—rationality and stability—are not attributes of human decision-making (Kahneman, 2011; Eagleman, 2012, 2015). This can be manipulated by:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Authority, where attackers pose as figures of authority (e.g., IT support, executives) to compel individuals to comply without questioning.</li>
                        <li>Urgency, where attackers induce a sense of urgency to force quick decision-making, often leading to mistakes.</li>
                        <li>Reciprocity, where attackers exploit the human tendency to return favors, such as offering a small incentive to gain trust.</li>
                        <li>Fear and pressure, where attackers leverage fear of negative consequences to prompt immediate action.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The implications of this behavior can result in data breaches, financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
                    <p>User awareness and training are essential components in maintaining a robust cyber security posture. Human behavior is influenced by knowledge, perception, and habitual practices. (Stefanovic, 2018 as cited in Johnson, J. (2020) states that humans are biased by (recent) past behavior, one of which mentions the Status Quo Bias. This bias prefers familiarity and tends to resist change, by using the current situation as an anchor, to perceive downward changes as losses and upward changes as gains. This is why having a basic knowledge and awareness of these potential biases in a small enterprise could be beneficial for owners. For example, the Ikea effect identifies that humans value things more once we have put effort into them. So, letting people try a product, and put their effort into learning it, makes them more likely to buy it. (Johnson, J. 2020. Designing with the Mind in Mind. 3rd Edition. [Waltham, MA]: Elsevier S & T). This can also be applied to not only clients, but staff to ensure by constantly being exposed to training and new threats, they will be more inclined to remember and be aware of it. Whilst this can be valuable, it is also important to ensure staff aren’t being exposed to cognitive overload, making them overwhelmed with information, causing them to fail to absorb critical security practices, leading to errors. Another point for consideration is risk perception, where staff can underestimate the likelihood and impact of cyber threats, leading to complacency.</p>
                    <p>Implications of can result in unintentional data leaks and increased vulnerability to attacks due to the gap between perceived and actual risk, leading to insufficient caution.</p>
                    <p>Insider threats, although rare, still pose a significant risk which arises from individuals within the organization who intentionally or unintentionally cause harm. An insider is any person who has or had authorized access to or knowledge of an organization’s resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems. (Cisa, Gov. N.D) Employees who feel undervalued or mistreated may engage in malicious activities as a form of retaliation. On the other hand, greed and opportunity may lead to temptation of financial gain or the perceived opportunity to exploit weaknesses can drive insiders to commit fraud or theft. Whilst these are intentional, the risk of unintentional tends to be more present due to negligence and ignorance.</p>
                    <p>These risks stem from a lack of awareness and understanding of security policies, influenced by cognitive biases such as optimism, belief that negative events are less likely to happen to oneself. (Sharot, T. 2011)</p>
                    <p>Implications from intentional insider threats can result in malicious data theft and sabotage, due to the psychological disgruntlement or opportunism leading to severe operational and reputational disruptions. This will naturally spill into financial impact, whether intentional directly through theft and indirectly through cost of remediation.</p>
                    <p>By recognizing the role of human behavior, cognitive biases, and emotional responses, organizations can better anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with these human elements. Addressing these factors through targeted strategies can significantly enhance an organization's cyber security posture and resilience against threats.</p>
