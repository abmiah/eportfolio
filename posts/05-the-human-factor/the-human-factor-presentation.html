                <p><b>1.	Personal Introduction </b></p>
                <p>Hi there. My name is Amrol Miah, and I am pursuing my MSc in Cyber Security through the University of Essex. Our current module, 'The Human Factor,' is the fifth in the program. I will provide an overview of the final unit, Unit 6, which focuses on The Human Factor. This unit builds on our individual essay that we completed in Unit 3 of this module, where we explored the role of human factors in a hypothetical cybersecurity scenario.</p>
                <p>The essay assignment focused on a startup that needed to integrate three human factors into its cybersecurity strategy.</p>
                <p><b>2.	What is The Human Factor?</b></p>
                <p>Before I delve into the solutions, it is imperative to define the Human Factor concept.</p>
                <p>According to Henshel et al. (2015), The Human Factor encompasses an individual's behavioural patterns and actions, which are integral components of human emotion. Yarwood (2022) categorises human emotions into four domains:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Behaviours,</li>
                        <li>Subjective feelings,</li>
                        <li>Thoughts, and</li>
                        <li>Physiology.</li>

                    </ul>

                <p>Notably, human emotion is a dynamic and constantly evolving subject of study, substantiated by ongoing research and the challenging of numerous theories. A study conducted by the University of West Alabama (2019) has evaluated this.</p>
                <p><b>3.	Overview of Essay</b></p>
                <p>In my essay, I begin by exploring the fundamental human elements that manifest as</p>
                <p>Behaviours or emotions within the workplace and their impact on cybersecurity.</p>
                <p>The three primary human factors I examined are</p>
                <p><b>Human error</b>, <b>insider threats</b>, and <b>security awareness and culture</b>.</p>
                <p>These factors play a critical role in shaping a robust cybersecurity strategy.</p>
                <p>In my next slide, I will provide a quick overview of those three human factors.</p>
                <p><b>Human error</b> encompasses instances such as falling victim to phishing scams, using weak passwords, or inadvertently exposing sensitive data.</p>
                <p><b>Insider threats</b> involve employees mishandling privileged data access within the organisational structure.</p>
                <p><b>Security awareness and culture</b> address the requirement for employees to comprehend the significance of cybersecurity and promote safety through comprehensive training and awareness programs.</p>
                <p><b>Human error:</b></p>
                <p>In my initial essay, I discuss how emotional intelligence, distinct from computational processes, influences human behaviour. Understanding the impact of human emotions is critical in cybersecurity, as human error significantly contributes to data breaches, emphasising the need to incorporate the human element into cybersecurity strategies.</p>
                <p><b>Possible Mitigation for Human Error:</b></p>
                <p><b>Using a simple password manager software:</b></p>
                <p>According to Chauhan and Panda (2015), the use of weak passwords, such as the classic "<b>password123</b>" or "<b>Password@123</b>," with an uppercase “<b>P</b>” has played a significant role in enabling threat actors to obtain access to systems.</p>
                <p>One might think having a long password would be the solution, but one must consider its guessability.</p>
                <p>According to Steinberg (2022), using long passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is a secure method for protecting systems.</p>
                <p>This is further supported by Bitwarden (2023), which states that passwords with a mixture of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and unique characters that are between 14 to 16 characters long will make it an impossible task for hackers to crack, compared to an eight-character password, which can take a skilled hacker 39 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Figure 1</b> is a chart from Bitwarden (2023) that illustrates the various complexities of passwords and their vulnerability to cracking.</p>
                <p>However, the main question is, if one has multiple systems with various complex passwords, users can unintentionally create issues by reusing, writing down, or even forgetting them.</p>
                <p>Remembering complex passwords comes with its own set of challenges. It is not easy for us to remember random strings of letters and numbers with special characters with no personal meaning.</p>
                <p>This is why many people resort to creating passwords with personal significance, such as their favourite sports team, followed by a memorable date, like a date of birth.</p>
                <p>Password managers such as <b>Google Password Manager</b>, <b>NordPass</b>, <b>LastPass</b> or <b>Bitwarden</b> store all your passwords in one secure location and can help users generate complex, non-dictionary-based passwords. They encrypt all your stored information, and some password managers can also store important notes or files such as recovery keys or Time-based One-Time Passwords, also known as T O T P (Bitwarden, 2023; Chauhan and Panda, 2015; Viezelyte, 2023; Steinberg, 2022).</p>
                <p>In April of this year, the UK government banned the use of common passwords, such as “<b>admin</b>” or “<b>1234</b>”, on IoT devices. This means that manufacturers can no longer supply products with default passwords already set (Carla, 2024; Gov.uk, 2024).</p>
                <p>This clearly indicates the importance of having a strong password for systems, IoTs, and other smart devices.</p>
                <p>Organisations should also consider other areas to reduce human error, such as enhancing data handling practices and creating incident response plans as part of their security strategy.</p>
                <p><b>Possible Mitigation for Insider Threat:</b></p>
                <p>In this section, I will focus on the malicious insider threat. Whether intentional or unintentional, these actions significantly contribute to data loss in organisations. Due to malicious actions or dark personality traits linked to antisocial behaviour, addressing human factors in cybersecurity measures is crucial.</p>
                <p>According to Borgeaud (2024), 50% of insider threats are financially motivated, such as insider trading or selling an organisation’s IP to a competitor. Personal gain accounts for 47% of insider threats, while revenge accounts for 45% of cases, and reputational damages account for 37% of incidents. All these malicious insiders have a common theme: to cause damage to the organisation either by data loss, financial or reputational.</p>
                <p>According to Liu et al. (2018), insider threats with privileged access to systems are often difficult to detect and to prevent; Steinberg (2022) also supports this notion, stating that the organisation's employees pose the most significant cyber threat to their institute.</p>
                <p><b>Possible mitigation:</b></p>
                <p>Enabling the <b>Principle of Least Privilege</b> is a concept that allows employees access to the system based on their job roles and nothing more. Providing employees access to a system that is not required within their responsibilities only increases the chances of data breaches if that employee becomes a threat (Cloudflare, 2024).</p>
                <p>An example of an employee working within the marketing department, they would only need to access folders and systems relating to their job role, such as the marketing folder, spending tracker, or CMS systems. They do not need access to HR or financial folders or access to the company infrastructure.</p>
                <p>To further enhance the <b>Principle of Least Privilege concept</b>, organisations can introduce regular monitoring of their systems to detect any unusual behaviours. Arguably, cybersecurity requires ongoing monitoring of logging and access. This is essential to alert the organisation of any unusual actions or behaviours before they can manifest and cause serious harm to the company (Netwrix, 2024).</p>
                <p>With <b>security awareness and culture</b>, evidence shows a lack of knowledge, understanding, and personal responsibility regarding cybersecurity incidents within organisational settings, emphasising the need for comprehensive cybersecurity awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><b>The solution:</b></p>
                <p>All employees should be required to participate in security training to help them identify potential cyber threats, such as phishing emails or social engineering scams. This training will also equip them with the knowledge and confidence to safeguard the organisation and themselves. Training and awareness should also be an ongoing progression, with employees regularly updating them with the latest news and information through refresher tests and practical exercises, such as being sent test phishing emails (MacKay, 2018; Steinberg, 2022).</p>
                <p>Creating a security culture is a crucial aspect of security management, and it extends beyond simply completing mandatory reading and testing.</p>
                <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (2023) emphasises that employees play a pivotal role in ensuring the organisation's security. Merely implementing technology or procedures is insufficient, as the social aspect is also vital. A strong security culture fosters an environment where employees mutually work and support each other through maintaining security.</p>
                <p>This includes.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Spotting problems and being more willing to provide suggestions to improve security.</li>
                        <li>Open communication amongst peers without the fear of being undermined</li>
                        <li>Employees’ general wellbeing and understanding of security will improve</li>
                    </ol>

                <p><b>4.	What are the social and ethical aspects of the human factors in cyber security?</b></p>
                <p>In the next couple of slides, I will quickly go over some ethical and social aspects.</p>
                <p>For organisations or businesses, considering cybersecurity as a long-term strategy can be a difficult decision as they will have to entrust all their data and any other sensitive information to a cybersecurity professional to protect the organisation’s data from cyber criminals who may pose a threat to the company</p>
                <p>Hiring a cybersecurity professional requires trust and a strong sense of ethics in identifying possible vulnerabilities (Augusta University, 2024).</p>
                <p>The social aspect of cybersecurity covers a wide range of topics, particularly concerning The Human Factor. According to Hadlington's (2018) research, the lack of social skills influences the malicious insider, as they tend to socially isolate themselves, with their only form of interaction being through online channels, such as social media, chatrooms and forums. Relying solely on computers for communication can make it difficult for individuals to cope with workplace situations. This can increase agitation and frustration, which may be taken out on the company.</p>
