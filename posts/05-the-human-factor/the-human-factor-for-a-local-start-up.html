                <p><b>1.	Introduction</b></p>
                <p>This report will delve into three significant human factors that often manifest as behaviours or emotions within the workplace environment. As a local startup company, it is crucial to understand that the human factor plays a pivotal role in cybersecurity. Implementing a robust cybersecurity strategy necessitates carefully analysing the following human factors.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Human Error</b> - Individuals falling victim to phishing scams, using weak passwords, or unintentionally exposing sensitive data.</li>
                    <li><b>Insider Threats</b> - Employees within the organisational structure with data access mishandle their privileged permissions.</li>
                    <li><b>Security Awareness and Culture</b> - Organisations to ensure that employees comprehend the significance of cybersecurity and actively promote safety through comprehensive training and awareness.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>2.	The Three Human Factors</b></p>
                <p><b>2.1.	Human Error	</b></p>
                <p>Humans differ from computers in fundamental ways. Unlike computers, humans are not designed to execute specific computational tasks. Being comprised of organic matter, requiring inorganic substances to sustain life; moreover, the human body is intricately complex (Chapman, 2023) and has, over time, developed emotional intelligence that can be categorised into four areas: 1) Behaviours, 2) Subjective feelings, 3) Thoughts, and 4) Physiology (Yarwood, 2022); however, according to the research conducted by the University of West Alabama (2019), emotion is still an ongoing study as many hypotheses are being questioned.</p>
                <p>Given a foundational understanding of human emotions and biology, it is imperative to examine the influence of this phenomenon on cybersecurity. According to Hughes-Lartey et al. (2021), organisations often overlook essential human factors, leading to breaches, and instead primarily focus on their technological infrastructure. Moreover, Liginlal et al. (2009) research found that human error accounted for 65% of data breaches. Schultz (2005) argues that security information should not be perceived solely as a technical problem but rather as a people problem, given that individuals are in control of technology and not technology controlling people, and yet so little attention has been given in this area of research. The occurrence of breaches within the working environment can be attributed significantly to human error. An impact on behavioural emotions may lead to unintentional or intentional breaches and thus warrants critical consideration.</p>
                <p><b>2.2.	Insider Threats</b></p>
                <p>An insider threat can manifest either intentionally or unintentionally; Adéle Da Veiga et al. (2023) argue that insider threats have been proven to be one of the main contributors to data loss, emphasising insider threats' significant impact on businesses. Reports reveal that more than 40% of breaches are attributed to inadvertent data disclosure by organisational personnel, with 94% of incidents involving males (Hughes-Lartey et al., 2021). However, according to Carnegie Mellon University (2013), an Unintentional Insider Threat (UIT) is constituted by employees, current and former, contractors, or business partners with access to company systems and data. These are significant factors of UIT caused by human error.</p>
                <p>One must acknowledge that UITs can arise from human error; however, it is essential to note that insider threats stemming from malicious actions by employees cannot be classified as human error; the case of Andrew Skelton demonstrated a malicious insider threat, who, after being provided with a formal warning exposed his colleague data online and even sent them to the press, Skelton was a senior IT auditor that had access to personal data abusing his privileges of company security not for financial gain but due to a grudge he had towards his seniors (The Guardian, 2020; Williams, 2021).</p>
                <p>According to Harms et al. (2022), numerous personality and behavioural factors significantly determine whether an employee may threaten the organisation. Among these factors are dark personality traits linked to antisocial or toxic behaviour.</p>
                <p><b>2.3.	Security Awareness and Culture</b></p>
                <p>In a research study conducted by Hore et al. (2024), it was determined that individuals within an organisational setting demonstrated a lack of knowledge, awareness, and personal responsibility regarding cybersecurity incidents. Additionally, various technological factors, such as heavy workloads, contributed to the lack of incentive for employees to consider cybersecurity measures. The research also unveiled that incident reporting and internet usage are potentially vulnerable.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted exclusively within the healthcare industry and did not consider other industries, particularly SaaS companies, whose products and services rely heavily on technology.</p>
                <p>Despite Hore et al. (2024) study, according to Taherdoost (2024), it is suggested that organisations incorporate cybersecurity awareness training for all employees. This measure aims to mitigate the potential impact of a cyber incident on company performance and should be considered an integral component of their overall cybersecurity strategy.</p>
                <p><b>3.	Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>In the context of the human factor, it is essential to contemplate the organisational measures aimed at fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness. This cultivation is vital in incentivising employees to detect potential threats, as any human error, intentional or unintentional, can have enduring repercussions on the organisation. Such repercussions may impact the organisation financially and result in reputational damage, ultimately eroding trust among customers/clients.</p>
