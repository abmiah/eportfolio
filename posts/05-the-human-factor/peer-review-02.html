                <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
                <p>The report examines the human factors in computing, underscoring the significance of human-computer interactions and enhancing user experiences. The analysis of three human factors in UX encompasses the assessment of system credibility, accessibility, and findability. The report concludes by highlighting the importance of user elicitation and the entirety of the product design process in human factors in computing.</p>
                <p><b>Key points:</b></p>
                <p>The author's exploration of the human element in computing to enhance user experience (UX) is a thought-provoking subject that offers a comprehensive overview of human interaction. The report is well-crafted and proficiently supports the author's research. However, it is worth noting that several in-text citations do not adhere to the Harvard referencing standard regarding publications with multiple authors, neglecting to utilise the abbreviation "et al." (El-Jouzi, 2024).</p>
                <p>Regrettably, the author's report neglected to address the security implications associated with the human factor. The human factor in cybersecurity encompasses a range of concerns, including insider threats, social engineering, training and awareness (NIST, n.d.; SecurityScorecard, 2024). This contrasts with the report's primary focus on the user experience of products and services. It is important to note that the report brief specifically requests a security strategy, not a user experience report. It is imperative to review the brief thoroughly and, if uncertain, seek guidance from the module professor or a fellow student.</p>

                    <p><em>by Daniel Malok - Friday, 28 June 2024, 12:30 PM</em></p>
                    <p><b>Human Factors Essay</b></p>
                    <p><b>1.0 Introduction to Human Factors</b></p>
                    <p>Human factors in computing concern human-computer interactions (HCIs) and how to satisfy and enhance user experiences (Kivijärvi & Pärnänen, 2023). Studies have demonstrated that effective and efficient utilization and comprehensive design of systems were crucial. The best means of evaluating user experience was by allowing the users to use a system in the simulated environment before production and then using a questionnaire to collect data about their experiences (Díaz-Oreiro, Gustavo, Luis & Luis, 2021). The result of the data analysis is then used to improve the system design. The key elements of HCI comprise the Internet of Things (IoT), speech recognition systems, virtual reality systems, eye tracking technology, obstacle detection systems, and artificial intelligence for sight, magnifiers, detections and screen readers.</p>
                    <p><b>2.0 Critical Analysis of three human factors for a Start-up firm</b></p>
                    <p><b>2.1 Credibility of Systems Human Factors and User Experience (UX)</b></p>
                    <p>According to Novák, Masner, Benda, Šimek and Merunka (2023), the credibility of systems is the ability of a system to perform the tasks that they were designed to do. A system's ability to perform as expected during the first test was critical to its credibility to the user. According to Gamage, Stomber, Jahanbakhsh, Skeet and Shahi (2022), systems designer should have multidisciplinary skills and knowledge in order to be able to capture the perspective of users and their experiences well and be able to develop systems that users deem as credible quickly. The credibility of systems is a kind of the first impression of a system and users' ability to trust and adopt it.</p>
                    <p><b>2.2 Accessibility of Systems, Human Factors and UX</b></p>
                    <p>The accessibility of a product or a service depends on its users' ability to use it easily (Sauer, Sonderegger & Schmutz, 2020). The accessibility of a system is not only limited to those with their full faculties but also those who are physically challenged. This means that people with various types of disabilities should be able to access the system with ease and comfort. These systems should be accessible through various means, including speech, reachability and approachability. The systems should also be easy to understand and use. Accessibility and HCI should ensure the inclusion of all people to use systems produced for public and private use.</p>
                    <p><b>2.3 Findability of Systems, Human Factors and UX</b></p>
                    <p>Frankford (2023) states that findability is locating information in the highly saturated digital space with multiple interfaces and platforms. This ensures that system users can quickly and efficiently get information within locally hosted systems or systems hosted on the cloud. The key elements to consider in UX when designing systems are search-ability and structuring of data and information (Zhao, Meroño-Peñuela & Simperl, 2024). The concept of findability in designs should not be misconstrued as important for search engines but all other systems. This means offline systems and databases should be designed with keywords that enable a fast and most efficient recall of information in all formats, including images, audio, videos, and text.</p>
                    <p><b>3.0 Conclusion</b></p>
                    <p>Schrepp, Kollmorgen, Meiners, Hinderks, Winter, Santoso and Thomaschewski  (2023) pointed out that HCI is important because it enables systems designers to elicit user requirements for the systems function and design. The key design considerations for HCI are the ability of usefulness, credibility, usability, findability, value of system, and accessibility to be considered during systems design. This implies that end users' usability, convenience, and productivity are the most important elements in HCI. The design of systems and HCI enhancement should always start from user elicitation and the product design process, sales, branding, and marketing.</p>
