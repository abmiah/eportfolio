                <p><b>Working Title 1:</b><br>
                    The Ethics of Data Science Companies Influencing or Manipulating Audiences on the Social Media Platform, Facebook.</p>

                <p><b>Working Title 2:</b><br>
                The Ethical Implications of Data Science Institutions in Manipulating and Influencing Audiences on the Social Media Platform Facebook.</p>

                <p>Both titles convey the same idea; they have simply been rephrased.</p>

                <p><b>Proposal Outline:</b></p>

                <p>This paper examines the ethical implications surrounding data science institutions, primarily the infamous Cambridge Analytica, which, according to  Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison (2018), acquired user data from the social media platform Facebook from an personality application test, which was claimed to be used for academic research, the application went onto harvesting the users network data as well, subsequently gaining access to over 50 million user profiles. Leveraging this extensive dataset, the organisation was able to design targeted advertisements tailored to individuals' personal data specifications, thereby attempting to influence public opinion toward a specific agenda. Such practices have been criticised, especially considering the collaboration with Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign and its purported involvement in the Brexit campaign in 2016. There are allegations that the firm exerted its influence on the Kenyan election once more through the utilisation of personal data acquired from social media platforms. While the particular social media platform in question requires further examination, it is purported that Facebook was employed by the company to gather this data (Crabtree, 2018).</p>
                <p>The issue of data misuse and breaches remains a persistent challenge across various industries. For instance, Facebook users frequently disclose personal details, such as their location, preferences, types of content they interact with, and cherished photos of family, friends, and beloved meals or pets. Additionally, users engage with their network and can share information. When someone in your network connects with an external user, that activity appears in your feed, prompting you to interact and possibly expand your circle of Facebook friends. While this may seem benign, the absolute risk comes from the multitude of data points gathered from each user. If such data were to fall into the hands of a third party, as seen in the Cambridge Analytica incident, they could exploit it to obtain a vast array of personal information on individual users.</p>
                <p>The primary focus of this paper extends beyond the issue of data breaches. However, it is important to acknowledge that Facebook has a history of breaches dating back to 2007, including the misinformation that Cambridge Analytica exploited. It is crucial to note that the issue of misinformation is not new; Facebook has faced ongoing criticism regarding the prevalence of this problem. Misinformation can result in discrimination against various groups based on race, religion, and sexual orientation, and it can escalate to online abuse.</p>
                <p>This paper does not aim to investigate the historical data breaches associated with Facebook comprehensively. Instead, it will concentrate on the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica and its use to promote tailored narratives to the users from whom this data was sourced.</p>
                <p>Facebook has implemented measures to combat misinformation. According to Rosen (2021), the company has taken steps to address the proliferation of false information but encounters numerous challenges. Additionally, it has faced criticism for contributing to disseminating misinformation, primarily because its algorithms are designed to maximise user engagement, which contrasts with Rosen’s assertions.</p>
                <p>This paper aims to critically analyse the Cambridge Analytica case study, particularly emphasising the scandal associated with the company’s operational practices. It will evaluate how these practices violated UK legislation concerning ethical standards and other relevant legal frameworks. Furthermore, this paper intends to identify deficiencies within the current legal landscape regarding data mismanagement, assessing the need for strengthened regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing data management practices. Additionally, the research will explore the unethical methodologies employed by Cambridge Analytica in their data acquisition from Facebook, arguing that Facebook should have implemented more robust security measures to protect users' data from unauthorised access by third-party applications, thereby ensuring compliance with institutional and individual consent.</p>
                <p>This study intends to undertake a comprehensive investigation into Cambridge Analytica's strategies employed in manipulating users to achieve its objectives successfully. Subject to the accessibility of pertinent information, this investigation will include a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding the data collected by the organisation. The analysis will also critically assess Facebook's extensive global reach concerning user data and the methodologies Cambridge Analytica used to extract information from the platform.</p>
                <p>In response to the actions of Cambridge Analytica, the term “fake news” has gained widespread recognition, typically denoting the dissemination of misinformation designed to mislead the public and influence public opinion. One potential solution to address this critical issue may involve the development of a technical code for verifying the authenticity of news content. By utilising a news API, this code can systematically traverse an extensive database of news articles, aggregating data from diverse sources to assess the accuracy of the information presented. This methodology aims to foster a more transparent and trustworthy informational environment, thereby assisting users in differentiating between fact and fiction. Furthermore, this framework could be integrated into Facebook’s application, enabling the platform to authenticate the legitimacy of content shared within its network.</p>
                <p>Further literature research must be conducted to determine whether the solution has been covered. This should consider both academic literature and Facebook misinformation solutions. Relying on information from Facebook can pose challenges, as educational researchers or independent government entities must independently verify these claims.</p>
                <p>As exemplified by Facebook, social media platforms enable individuals to connect irrespective of geographical location. This connectivity fosters ongoing relationships with family and friends, enhancing social interaction. Furthermore, businesses can improve their visibility through strategic marketing and engagement efforts. Nevertheless, users must maintain a critical awareness regarding the material they consume, necessitating verifying its authenticity and considering its validity. Since users allocate a significant portion of their time to social media platforms, they frequently encounter news disseminated through these channels. When information originates from reputable news organisations such as The Guardian or the BBC, it is important to note that the platform often has no intrinsic mechanism to authenticate its credibility. Users are therefore encouraged to conduct independent searches to corroborate the information presented.</p>
                <p>By informing users about misinformation, they can adopt a civilised approach to the information, avoid sharing it within their circles, and even take the initiative to report it to platform moderators. If this issue is not addressed, misinformation will continue to spread.</p>
