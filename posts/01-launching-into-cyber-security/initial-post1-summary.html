            <article>
                <p>The preliminary discussion focused on internal data breaches caused by <strong>Malicious</strong> or <strong>Non-Malicious</strong> insiders; both groups can be deemed loyal and trustworthy, as employees are the driving force for any organisation, small or big. </p>
                <p>The initial discussion mentioned VM Morrisons 2014 internal data breach; with a workforce of over 120,000, this is comparatively small compared to Walmart, an American retail store that employs approximately 2.3 million people (Armstrong, 2023; WM Morrison Supermarkets Limited, n.d.). </p>
                <p>Over the years, Walmart has invested heavily in Cybersecurity, building a team of professionals to protect their operations and customers training 2.3 million of their employees and associates. Walmart understands the internal and external threats a cyber incident could pose to its operation; with 6 trillion data points being processed annually, Walmart has built an internal automated system to aid with the processing, with security measures implemented to mitigate any threats (Geisler III, 2022; Eide, 2022). </p>
                <p>In August 2023, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had 10,000 of their staff members' information exposed due to <em>human error</em> (Jackson, 2023; Milmo, 2023). During the same month, Norfolk and Suffolk police exposed 1,230 data belonging to victims, witnesses and case suspects due to a <em>technical issue</em> (Robinson, 2023; 2023 Suffolk Constabulary, 2023; Powell, 2023) </p>
                <p>Although these data breaches were caused with non-malicious intent, the data breach could endanger the lives of police officers and witnesses. One would imagine the UK police force would have a robust security system and training to mitigate such incidents. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, this aids one case that cybersecurity training is vital to safeguard confidential data; the vast majority of employees do not intend to expose internal data but may lack the skills and training to spot phishing emails or the understanding of the correct method of data handling. Running regular risk assessments, monitoring network access, and restricting access based on employment duties will reduce internal data breaches. </p>
