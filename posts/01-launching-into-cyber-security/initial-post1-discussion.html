            <article>
                <p>A study conducted by both IBM and the World Economic Forum concluded that 95% of cyber security issues are caused internally by human error. According to both organisations, in 2020 alone, internal errors caused the losses of millions due to data leaks by spear-phishing email, whereby unintentional victims would click/download files exposing confidential information, but this is just one example of many. Victims that unintentionally disclose internal data are referred to as <strong>Non-Malicious</strong> Insiders, whose intention was not malicious, with no financial or political gain (engineeringnews.co.za, 2022; Zhadan, 2022; Barker, 2020).</p>
                <p>The <strong>Malicious Insiders</strong>, however, are either financially or politically motivated; two examples which made headline was the case of 2014, Andrew Skelton, who worked for VM Morrison, after receiving a disciplinary warning, exposed approximately 100,000 of his colleagues' personal information, including bank account details, online, his reason was merely a 'grudge' on the company. This has caused reputational damages, and their employees sued the store for the data breach; in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that VM Morrison was not held liable for the actions of Andrew Skelton; he was sentenced to eight years for fraud (theguardian.com, 2020; Barker, 2020; Croft, 2020; Jones, 2020).</p>
                <p>Another example is the case of Edward Snowden, who exposed confidential information to the public on WikiLeaks; Snowden's motive is argued to be politically motivated, as he felt the government was upholding information from the public (Barker, 2020; MacAskill, 2023).</p>
                <p>Snowden (2013) states that:</p>
                <p>
                <blockquote> "We trusted the government not to screw us. But they did. We trusted the tech companies not to take advantage of us. But they did. That is going to happen again, because that is the nature of power." </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Organisations need to implement better training for their employees and understand the importance of cybersecurity, the reputational damage it may cause, and the repercussions brought against the perpetrator that intentionally discloses an organisation's data (Carlton, et al., 2019).</p>

                    <p>Very interesting post Amrol, thanks for sharing. Many companies are conducting pen testing on regular basis to detect any potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, they are requesting vendors to upgrade their environment to have all needed fixes and updates. For example, in my current work we are upgrading debian and docker on all cloud deployments, since the latest versions have the latest security fixes.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts on insider attacks.</p>
                    <p>Insider threats are a significant problem, given that they have more knowledge about the companies’ inner workings than regular attackers, and have more effective ways to study an organization’s cyber defenses than a regular outside threat actor has. This can be due to multiple factors, such as personal associations and friendships with employes in the cyber security department and, in some instances, physical access to security-relevant systems. Possible ideas to defend against these types of attacks are implementing a least privilege system and enforcing a strict separation of duties (Netwrix Corporation 2023). This can help to minimize the damage a single person can do (Netwrix Corporation 2023). Unfortunately, this is difficult to implement in a meaningful way, as this goes against some companies’ principles of having an open and cooperative working environment, as enforcing these security measures requires a certain level of distrust between employees. This is often not desired.</p>

                    <p>Mohammed - your post further re-iterates the importance of investing in cyber security. Maintaining up-to-date software to patch security flaws is easily underestimated. </p>
                    <p>Julius - Implementing access controls and enforcing separation of duties is a good way to defend against cyber attacks. It's unfortunate that this goes against some company principles, as a company can still implement these whilst maintaining a good and co-operative working environment. </p>
                    <p>Operating in a way that is cyber secure should take precedence. </p>

                    <p>Dear Amrol, </p>
                    <p>I would agree with you that human error is one of the leading causes of cyber security breaches. It is one of the most common errors that lead to successful cyber attacks rather than a problem with the technology (Amoresano, 2023). </p>
                    <p>I would further your point by saying that it can be argued that employees are a company’s biggest asset. If employees are the main cause of compromising cyber security then they are positioned to have a major influence on society and harm democracy, this re-iterates the fact that this is indeed a global issue (Troncoso, 2019). </p>
                    <p>Investing in cyber security can help mitigate this risk. One way to do this would be through training as you have rightly highlighted. </p>
                    <p>Investing in cyber security also allows businesses to remain productive which allows them to positively contribute to the economy. For example, the use of patch management would reduce the chances of vulnerabilities being exploited by cyber criminals as exploitation may lead to a disruption of business activities. Even if a company were to have a business continuity and disaster recovery plan in place to mitigate the impact of this, they would still need to invest in cyber security to incorporate it. </p>
                    <p>Another important aspect to consider is the importance of fostering trust between the company, its customers and its partners. Investing in cyber security would strengthen this business relationship, improve the company’s reputation thus enabling them to yield greater profits which benefits society as a whole. </p>

                    <p>Dear Amrol,</p>
                    <p>You're absolutely right. Your post highlights an intriguing perspective. Corruption and insider attacks indeed present significant challenges to corporations, particularly in underdeveloped countries. In such contexts, where sensitive information, personal data, and bank account details are susceptible, internal actors can compromise security due to a variety of human motivations. This underscores the complexity of cybersecurity, extending beyond external threats to encompass internal vulnerabilities and the multifaceted motivations that can drive them. </p>

                    <p>Dear Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for sharing an interesting topic, </p>
                    <p>Your post raises a crucial point about the human factor, as there is an increasing consensus that the human factor, including managing the accompanying human strengths and weaknesses, is crucial to adequate cyber security protection and prevention, regardless of the severity of an incident. Human mistakes and insider attacks account for the vast majority of cyber security issues. Human errors make up 95% of cyber security breaches, according to Cybint Solutions (2020). Also, IBM found that insider incidents formed 13% of all OT (Operational Technology) -related incidents in 2020, with 60% of those incidents being caused by the actions of malicious insiders and 40% being the result of negligence (Widdowson et al., 2022). </p>
                    <p>Cybersecurity training for employees has numerous advantages. In the first place, it shows workers how to protect sensitive information, for example, bank records, customer information, and trade secrets. The company's reputation and bottom line can benefit from this measure. Second, because of their compliance with regulations, businesses that invest in cybersecurity training save money. Third, it helps staff recognize and avoid potential phishing and malware attacks. Fourth, it improves output by teaching people to be both safe and effective in the workplace. Finally, investing in cybersecurity training shows customers that the organization values their personal information by making an effort to protect it (IIPD - Institute of Innovation and Professional Development, 2022). </p>
