               <p>Early humans discovered fire about a million years ago. Although the exact timeline is still debated, archaeological findings suggest that burnt materials were found in early Homo Sapiens settlements. Fast forward to 2023, and society has rapidly adopted artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) (Gregersen, 2019; Greengard, 2023).</p>
               <p>In today's digital landscape, businesses embrace new technologies to enhance efficiency and lower their overheads and costs while increasing their profit margins (Astapciks, 2023). This is further supported by Wei et al. (2019), who highlight how technological innovations, such as data storage, have reduced business costs. As more industries recognise the importance of digital solutions, manual paper-based methods, such as storing physical documents in filing cabinets, are quickly becoming outdated.</p>
               <p>However, advances in technology also produce vulnerabilities within the software/hardware themselves as companies that create them are trying to launch their products into the market to gain a competitive edge; in doing so, security can be overlooked, which is then exploited by cybercriminals (Barker, 2023). This is further supported by Sun et al. (2023), who suggest that vulnerable software technologies create opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit. Spremić et al. (2018) found that cybersecurity received a meagre of 1% of the budget allocation in research in various Croatian companies, with responsibility solely for the IT department. (Barker, 2023) emphasises that cybersecurity practices should be implemented by all members of an organisation, including identifying phishing emails and social engineering. Safeguarding any industry fully immersed in the digital landscape should consider cybersecurity as one of its primary initiatives; the World Economic Forum has listed cyberattacks as one of its global risks (World Economic Forum, 2023).</p>
               <p>Regarding the world energy crisis, one agrees that improvement is needed, especially in developing countries with increasing GDP but lacking infrastructure to supply sufficient electricity. The use of fossil fuels is not sustainable as they are the leading cause of greenhouse emissions that affect not only the lives of humans but also have damaging effects on animals and the environment (Wei et al., 2019; Ozili, P. K. 2023).</p>

                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    <p>I admire your first sentence and comparison of Homo Sapiens settlements to today, 2023, which is a great representation of how far we have come, as people, and as technology. You also mention the use of artificial intelligence and IoT. I do agree that breakthroughs in intelligent human-computer interaction technology often open up new digital service scenarios. The IoT also simplifies and automates tasks that are complicated and sometimes beyond the scope of human capabilities.</p>
                    <p>For example, in AI, the latest digital human technology, through synthetic voice, emotion, visual image and three-dimensional graphic modeling. As much as this may benefit digital enterprises from one perspective, it can also be a disadvantage in other perspectives, as it can be used by malicious actors to formulate new types of cyber-attacks. Having background in cyber related crime, I have often seen these new types of attacks, which use AI generated synthetic imaging and videos to represent an individual who has a reputable position within a company, to falsely advertise a campaign, in hopes that their ‘audience’ fall for the scam, which unfortunately often lead to monetary losses.</p>
                    <p>I also agree with your views on improvements needed surrounding the energy crisis, and the topic in general. The use of fossil fuels is not sustainable which has shown over the decades in environmental damages which have affected us in some ways as well. The energy crisis leaves behind important lessons regarding the energy transition. One important lesson we learn from the crisis is that the energy transition process will have disruptive effects through supply shocks, rising energy demand and rising prices. Policy makers need to find a way to make the energy transition less painful by ensuring that there are enough energy reserves in order to meet energy demand during transition process. Future studies and implementations of new technologies can perhaps help this long term issue the world has been facing.</p>

                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for this interesting post.</p>
                    <p>I agree with your argument on the importance of embracing new technologies for organizations to lower their cost and enhance efficiency, this was examined by Zai et al (2022) who argued that new digital technologies enable major business improvements. Moreover, they highlight that when organization embraces in digital transformation, it has lower cost, better operating efficiency, and better innovation success which can lead to better performance. However, with new technologies come new risks; scientific research shows that with the increasing number of connected computers and nodes in the cyberspace, the threat of malicious attacks has become a concern for organization (Cabaj et al, 2018). Hence, cybersecurity should be an integral part of the organization and, as you mentioned, cybersecurity practices should be implemented by all members of an organization. In this context, security training and awareness should be conducted to all employees.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p><em>by Wiley Finch - Tuesday, 21 November 2023, 10:01 AM</em></p>
                    <p>Hi Amrol,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your interesting take on the security implications of the digital economy. It’s a very conclusive statement that security is often overlooked, even if it’s supported by the fact that cybersecurity budgets in Croatian companies only make up 1% of the total budget (Spremić and Šimunic, 2018).</p>
                    <p>The research done by Spremić and Šimunic (2018) has a lot of similarities to the research done by Moore, Dynes, and Chang (2016). The main difference between both studies is the location and therefore the research group, where the latter research focuses on the USA. The research of Moore, Dynes, and Chang (2016) states that 81% of the subjects interviewed reported support for their cybersecurity efforts by their upper-level management. The research even concludes that as a result of senior management support budget is generally not a limitation for non-governmental entities (Moore, Dynes, and Chang, 2016).</p>
                    <p>A clarification for the huge difference between both studies can be found in the different stages of digitalization as demonstrated by Wei, Sanbron, and Slaughter (2019). It could be that some countries, like the USA, are further advanced in the stages of becoming fully digital then Croatian companies. Another clarification could be the view on cyber security from a political/social standpoint. The study of Moore, Dynes, and, Chang (2016) reports on a CISO that could not recall or even estimate the cybersecurity budget, as it is not a separate item but is what he calls an ‘attribute’ of business. My advice for companies looking to become more digital is to inherit the same vision as this company and embed cyber security not as a tool of protection but as an ‘attribute’ of the business processes.</p>
