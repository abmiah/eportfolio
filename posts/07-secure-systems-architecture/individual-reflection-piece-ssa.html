                <p><b>1. Introduction </b></p>
                <p>The Secure System Architecture (SSA) module, led by Dr. Zeeshan Siddiqui, began with a thorough introduction to its fundamental principles. The concept encapsulates a framework within information technology design that effectively addresses security requirements while concurrently maintaining its core functionality. The SSA framework aligns with the CIA triad's foundational principles, emphasising confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
                <p>The SSA module comprises six units encompassing two principal assignments, one of which is a collaborative project. This collaborative project then serves as a foundational component for the culminating assignment, which entails developing Python OOP code based on the outcomes derived from the activities of the initial group.</p>

                <p><b>2. Initial approach to the module</b></p>
                <p>I started the module with the first unit lecturecast on SSA, which introduced complex concepts and unfamiliar acronyms like CATWOE and SSM. The "check your knowledge" section was challenging, necessitating multiple readings to understand fully. Despite the difficulties, I managed to complete it but recognised the need for further study to grasp secure architecture concepts fully.</p>

                <p><b>3. Group Assignment </b></p>
                <p>The professor organised students into collaborative groups, and we held several online meetings to discuss the project. We analysed the project brief and outlined specific objectives, reconvening a week later to present our findings. A fellow peer took on a leadership role due to their deep understanding of the subject, skills with ADTool, and ability to generate a diagram from the ADTool tree.</p>
                <p>ADTool allows the creation of diagrams based on Systems of Systems (SoS), helping to identify vulnerabilities while prioritising security risks. My initial attempts with ADTool were unproductive due to Java installation issues on my Mac. A colleague illustrated the tool's functionality, noting no challenges on Windows. After discussing my issues with Professor Dr Siddiqui, I used a virtual machine to successfully install Windows and operate ADTool, allowing me to contribute further to the project. I conducted additional research to enhance my teammates' contributions.</p>
                <p>At the end of the assignment, we must peer review the collaboration’s effectiveness. Each group member performed well, but while some contributions were minimal, others exceeded expectations.</p>

                <p><b>4. Main Assignment </b></p>
                <p>The final assignment required that students generate code using the Python object-oriented programming (OOP) framework. Initially, I found it imperative to conduct a rapid review of several tutorials to reacquaint myself with OOP, given that a significant amount of time had elapsed since my last engagement with this subject matter. The principles associated with classes and methods can often present challenges in comprehension; fortunately, I only required a brief refresher to achieve clarity.</p>
                <p>Using Python OOP coding frameworks with an ADTool vulnerability diagram created a solid foundation for SoS testing principles. In developing my programme, I incorporated new modules like "requests" and "sockets," necessitating extensive consultation of the Python documentation. Despite the numerous challenges of debugging and unforeseen functions and methods with classes that refuse to operate, the process was stimulating and rewarding, as witnessing my code successfully execute all intended tests. I also considered the several security implications of my code, including several “try” and “except” for error handling. While I initially intended to use Bandit to identify vulnerabilities, this aspect exceeded my original assignment parameters.</p>

                <p><b>5. Further learning</b></p>
                <p>My dedication to learning extends beyond this course; motivated by a desire for knowledge, I seek to enhance my grasp of the subject matter, especially in Docker, for my career advancement. I've pinpointed a specific area I wish to explore, fostering my personal growth.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A better understanding of Python OOP.</li>
                    <li>A better understanding of Docker.</li>
                    <li>Employ CRUD principles through frameworks like Flask or Django, necessitating an in-depth study of these.</li>
                    <li>Update e-portfolio.  </li>
                </ul>
