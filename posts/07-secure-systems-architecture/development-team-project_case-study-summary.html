                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>In this post, we explore several case studies and carefully analyse each one to select a specific focus for our ADTool group report. This post discusses an article by Kodali et al. (2016) titled "IoT-Based Smart Security and Home Automation System." To read the full group report, click on the following link: <a href="../../posts/07-secure-systems-architecture/development-team-project-group-submission.html" target="_self">Development Team Project: Design Document—Group Submission</a>.}</p>

                <p>The article discusses Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart security systems and home automation. It describes a system that enables remote monitoring and control. The focus is on a smart wireless home security system designed to alert users in case of unauthorised entry or trespassing. This feature enables users to respond quickly and raise an alarm.</p>
                <p>The triggering ability also allows the user to control various appliances within the house. This can also enable users to decide when they return home and have the system activate appliances such as the TV.</p>
                <p>This system is relatively cost-effective, compatible with any platform, and can be accessed from anywhere. It utilises PIR motion sensors to detect individuals' presence and can be controlled via a mobile phone keypad. The IoT security system also provides instructions on how to set it up, lists the necessary components, and suggests potential future improvements. The system has the following key features and benefits.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trespass detection – detect unauthorised entries</li>
                    <li>Alert mechanism – send alerts to the user via wifi connectivity </li>
                    <li>Optional alarm – the user can trigger the alarm </li>
                    <li>Enhanced security – providing real-time monitoring and alerts via phone call </li>
                    <li>Remote access  - the user receives alerts allowing control of the system remotely </li>
                    <li>Automation – the integration of security features </li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Kodali et al., 2016)</p>

                <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
                <blockquote>“Since the launchpad sends a voice call to only a particular number which is present in the web API there is no need to worry about security leakage as the system cannot be accessed by any other unauthenticated user. This in turn increases the fidelity of the security system.”</blockquote>
                <p>The potential vulnerability here is that voice calls can be hacked, or if the system has been breached, threat actors can override it. </p>
                <blockquote>“The use of wifi enabled launchpad in the system enables the system to be controlled from any part of the globe contrary to Blue-tooth controlled or IR remote controlled existing home automation solutions that too without any net connectivity in the phone.”</blockquote>
                <p>This has the potential threat actors to attack the system from any jurisdiction.</p>

                <p><b>Possible vulnerabilities:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Weak authentication</b>
                        <p>Numerous IoT devices possess weak, hard-coded, or easily guessable default passwords that users frequently neglect to alter. This vulnerability allows attackers to quickly obtain unauthorised access (Mirza, 2024; Trendmicro, 2020).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Insecure Network Service</b>
                        <p>IoT devices often use unsecured protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, to send data unencrypted, which makes the data susceptible to interception (Mirza, 2024).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Outdated software or firmware</b>
                        <p>Numerous IoT devices operate on obsolete operating systems or firmware that manufacturers no longer support, making them vulnerable to known exploits (Mirza, 2024; Bodnar, 2023).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Botnet</b>
                        <p>Compromised IoT devices can be exploited to create larger botnets that launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as exemplified by the notorious Mirai botnet attack (Balbix, 2020; Trendmicro, 2020).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data breaches</b>
                        <p>Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to access sensitive data on or transmitted by IoT devices (Mirza, 2024; Bodnar, 2023).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>User awareness</b>
                        <p>Many users do not have security awareness, leaving smart devices vulnerable to attacks (Trendmicro, 2020).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Lack / insufficient updates</b>
                        <p>Numerous IoT devices do not have adequate update processes, or users often neglect to apply updates, which exposes them to emerging threats (Bodnar, 2023).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Addressing these risks requires a holistic strategy that encompasses collaboration among manufacturers, end-users, and information technology specialists. This collaboration is essential to ensure that adequate security protocols are established and maintained within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.</p>
