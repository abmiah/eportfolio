                <p> To begin with, it is essential to elucidate the definitions and applications of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the Systems Modelling Language (SysML). UML is a standardised modelling language used to generate various diagrams, facilitating developers’ visualisation of the multifaceted complexities inherent in object-oriented software systems (Visual Paradigm, 2019). SysML is an extension of UML, explicitly designed to analyse complex systems. It is a general-purpose modelling language applicable to various aspects of systems engineering, encompassing software, hardware, and human interactions (Ahmed, 2024; SysML, n.d.; SysML.org, n.d.).</p>
                <p> <b>The difference between the two tools</b></p>
                <p> UML primarily concentrates on modelling the structures and behaviours of software systems using OOP methodologies. In contrast, SysML is tailored explicitly for systems engineers. It encompasses a broader spectrum of disciplines than those addressed by UML enables the modelling of more intricate systems, such as those in the automotive sector. Another significant distinction between SysML and UML is that SysML is comparatively lightweight, utilising fewer values and constraints (SysML.org, n.d.). The nature of the project in question fundamentally determines the selection of an appropriate modelling language. For software-based projects, UML is often deemed ideal. Conversely, for comprehensive systems engineering projects that integrate both software and hardware components, SysML is more suitable as it effectively addresses the complexities inherent in such multidisciplinary environments.  </p>
                <p> Chabibi et al. (2018) examine the integration of SysML, a practical system modelling language, with simulation environments such as MATLAB/Simulink. They propose utilising a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to bridge the gaps between systems effectively modelling and simulation processes. </p>
                <p> Cao et al. (2021) articulate a distinct methodology wherein the SysML model is transformed into executable Function Block (FB) models. They contend that the currently established approach is not amenable to automation; instead, it necessitates several procedural steps, particularly executing the semantics of hybrid automation (HA), which serves as the foundation for SysML. This methodology is justified by the capacity of the IEC 61499 FB to effectively illustrate the behaviour of controlled applications while simultaneously managing control plants through the modelling of interactions between SysML and FB.</p>

                    <p><em>by Daniel Malok - Wednesday, 13 November 2024, 1:40 PM</em></p>
                    <p>Dear Amrol Miah</p>
                    <p>Thank you for indicating the differences between the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the Systems Modelling Language (SysML). According to Romanov and Shpotya (2020), SysML has two critical limitations: the development of legions for specific software environments and the incompatibilities challenges brought about by the rapid evolution of standards like functional mock-up interface (FMI). The use and application of FMI require training, an understanding of the standards, and proper requirements elicitation. FMI also introduces overhead challenges regarding the interoperability of various tools, a steep learning curve, and the need to synchronize and exchange data. Bazydło (2023) affirmed that UML was crucial to various approaches and models for driven development (MDD). However, Bazydło (2023) emphasized that it does not address the issue of complexity in software development, is software version specific, dependent, and is risk averse by conception. The lack of standardization in some elements of UML diagrams can also confuse a large project with multiple stakeholders involved.</p>
