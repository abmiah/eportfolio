                <p><strong> Overview of the course and various activities: </strong></p>
                <p> Within the <b>Network Security</b> Model, six distinct units focus on various components of a selected website. As part of the initial unit, students were presented with multiple website choices, from e-commerce to service-oriented. Ultimately, pchelpme.org.uk was chosen due to its intuitive navigation and exceptional utilisation of negative space. According to Hesterberg (2017), negative space or whitespace is the area between design elements that provides visual pauses, reduces distractions, and assists users in concentrating. In the case of pchelpme.org.uk, this negative space expertly directs users to submit tickets for their IT concerns.</p>
                <p> Students were also tasked with engaging in two discussion forums as a coursework component, which will last two weeks. The initial forum centred on the <b>Security Implications of the Digital Economy</b>. Students were required to peruse extracts from the works of Spremić and Šimunic (2018) and Wei et al. (2019) and examine the influence of technology on our existence. The discussion further delved into the significance of adopting cybersecurity measures and the necessity for enhancements in the global energy predicament.</p>
                <p> The other discussion was based on <b>Logging for Security Analysis versus The issue of log-related Exploits</b> reading extracts from Berger (2021) and Ekelhart et al. (2018). This discussion emphasises the significance of logging and log management for security purposes. It highlights the risks associated with manual log monitoring and the impact of software vulnerabilities, notably the Log4Shell vulnerability. Additionally, it mentions the discovery of a zero-day vulnerability, which is a matter of concern.</p>
                <p> During week two, students must participate actively in a discussion by presenting their arguments and counterarguments and summarising the conversation.</p>
                <p> Dr Khan, Network Security tutor, held a number of seminars;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Introduction Session </li>
                    <li> The Solar Wind Breach Case Study </li>
                    <li> Breach Analysis Case Study </li>
                    <li> The Debate – The Future of the Internet </li>
                </ol>

                <p> All students were asked to create a presentation deck, except for the first session, in which they were introduced to the course of exploration and possible mitigation. Dr Khan divided the students into groups in the final seminar and assigned a subject area to research. One of the topics given was the following: <b>It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD)</b>. During the session, the students presented their case for why their approach was the future of the Internet. They also provided counterarguments to the other group members. Read <a href="../../posts/02-network-security/slide-presentation-future-of-the-internet.html">The Future of the Internet</a> to view the presentation deck.</p>
                <p><strong> Final assessment:</strong></p>
                <p> From the chosen website, students are required to conduct several vulnerability tests using the computer terminal and run a traceroute command, a tool designed to find routing hops and identify any delays as the data travels through the nodes. Traceroute can also identify areas where it could not obtain data; this is referred to as the point of failure. Students were instructed to refrain from running a ping test on the chosen website due to the unpredicted results; ping commands are designed to test if an IP address exists (Zola, 2021; Fortinet.com, 2023).</p>
                <p> During the unit, students are tasked with conducting a comprehensive vulnerability test using the tools available in the Kali Linux operating system. To prepare for this, they must conduct a vulnerability audit and assessment using the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain methodology. This approach enables students to identify the various stages of a cyber-attack, from initial reconnaissance to data extraction. The methodology is valuable in preventing security breaches, ransomware attacks, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) (Lockheed Martin, 2023).</p>
                <p> With a background in user experience, one began by conducting a thorough site audit to understand the site's usability. Using a flow chart, analysed user navigation through the website and identified potential vulnerabilities. The results revealed several areas that did not adhere to standard web design practices. For instance, users were not prompted to log in before submitting a ticket, there was no user verification process, and the SPAM prevention system was outdated. </p>
                <p> Multiple vulnerabilities that may not be immediately apparent to users were discovered during a security check conducted with Kali Linux scanning tools. By utilising tools like Nmap, Whatweb, and Nikto, it was determined that various vulnerabilities existed through open ports, including Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. These vulnerabilities were attributed to outdated technologies such as Bootstrap and jQuery. </p>
                <p> Initially, performing the scan was not an easy task. The reason behind this was that installing Kali Linux was quite complicated and time-consuming. It required the installation of VirtualBox to operate an additional operating system without overriding the existing one. Unfortunately, no resources or instructions were available via the module resources, so one had to ask for assistance from fellow peers and watch various YouTube videos to understand how to get Kali Linux and VirtualBox running. </p>
                <p> Following the completion of the first task, another obstacle presented itself - the website was not loading correctly. Initially, it was believed to be an internet-related issue. However, the investigation revealed that numerous students were experiencing similar problems. Ultimately, the resolution involved utilising a VPN. Surfshark VPN was recommended by a peer; however, the installation process through Kali Linux posed difficulties, particularly for those unfamiliar with the Linux operating system. </p>
                <p><strong> Further Learning:</strong></p>
                <p> Through one experience with utilising Kali Linux, one has gained significant insight into vulnerability testing. This has emphasised the critical nature of recognising the vast array of tools available. Understanding and analysing test reports is vital for any aspiring cybersecurity professional. By doing so, one can equip themselves with the necessary means and tools to prevent cyber threats and excel in the field. </p>
