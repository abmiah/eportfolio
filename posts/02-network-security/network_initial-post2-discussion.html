                <p>Logging involves capturing text-based data from different applications and storing it in a file. This file is then scrutinised for possible security risks, making log management a vital aspect of adhering to various regulations, such as ISO 27001. Essentially, logging is a means of monitoring events that take place within a system or application. It aids in detecting and resolving problems, tracking user behaviour, and overseeing system efficiency. Effective log management guarantees that the logs are kept safe and only accessible to authorised individuals (Cobb, M. 2021).</p>
                <p>When it comes to monitoring potential cyber threats, businesses may encounter difficulties with login procedures that can be complex and prone to errors, especially when relying on manual examination (Ekelhart et al., 2018).</p>
                <p>In addition to manual logging, software vulnerabilities can significantly impact security and safety. As reported by Berger (2021), the Log4Shell vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, a Java module for logging error messages, can potentially cause severe harm and affect several popular games, including the widely-known Minecraft. CVE-2021-11228 warns that malicious actors can remotely access systems and take control of devices running Log4j 2. While a patch was released on December 6th, 2021, three additional patches were issued during the same month (Berger, A. 2021; Mitre.org, 2021).</p>
                <p>The discovery of an attack on a vulnerability first brought to attention on November 24th, 2021, is equally concerning. The fact that threat actors may have been aware of the vulnerability before its discovery on December 9th classifies it as a zero-day vulnerability. Since the software was released, there were no days to create a patch before threat actors could exploit it (Berger, A. 2021; Trendmicro.com, 2023).</p>

                    <p>Dear Amrol,</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your post. You pointed out that an essential component of log management is the ISO 27001 regulation. Logs are necessary to establish an event chronology and spot patterns inside an organisation's network, as ISMS (2022) noted. Transparent and readily available log information creation is critical to every organisation's ICT strategy.</p>
                    <p>I share your concern regarding any mistakes that businesses could make when logging in. Ahola (2021) emphasised that 95% of cybersecurity vulnerabilities result from human error, citing IBM research. As noted by Berger (2021), attackers can remotely manipulate a machine by sending text messages to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability has received the highest-level severity score of 10 out of 10 from the Apache Software Foundation's Log4j 2 library. This is due to the simplicity with which malevolent attackers can take advantage of it and its potential for broad exploitation. The core elements of the Log4j vulnerability are still present despite ongoing mitigation attempts, and the harm it causes is still being felt.</p>
                    <p>You also mentioned the potential impact of software vulnerabilities on security. Security Journey (2023) says that to prevent any oversights in security logging and monitoring, Security Journey recommends that all significant security events be logged, log files be securely stored, precautions be taken to avoid unauthorised access or tampering, logs be regularly reviewed and analysed, real-time monitoring systems be established, a comprehensive incident response plan be created, and continuous improvement be pursued by reviewing past incidents and responding to emerging threats.</p>
                    <p>Cobb (2021) emphasises that log files are records of IT system occurrences that provide security teams with a crucial audit trail. They assist companies in recognising patterns in their operations, conducting general audits, and complying with rules and guidelines. However, logging can be challenging for large businesses that produce hundreds of gigabytes of data. Therefore, monitoring, assessing, and reacting to logs is essential to prevent aggressive and unlawful behaviour.</p>

                    <p>I agree with your point that says there is a need for timely patching and also for pointing out the vulnerabilities associated with zero-day exploits. Everson et al. (2022) also echo the importance of situational awareness and continuous monitoring to combat vulnerabilities and mitigate the impact of critical open-source library vulnerabilities.</p>
                    <p>Also, your mention of the interconnectedness and dependencies among different platforms and services shows the complexity of modern information systems. Schmidt et al. (2012) also say that there is a necessity of advanced, automated, and context-aware log analysis to address the evolving security challenges, including prompt patching and continuous monitoring.</p>

                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    <p>This is a very interesting and insightful post. I was not previously aware of the ISO 27001 regulations. Having done some research on it, I can see how some of these regulations can play a key role in logging. For example, event logging, storage, protection of log information and analysis, which specifically states that logs must be analyzed at regular intervals to ensure that unusual behavior and errors are properly detected and investigated in a timely manner. (Segovia, A. 2015)</p>
                    <p>I think also plays a key role in helping organizations avoid potentially costly security breaches by being able to show customers, partners and shareholders that they have taken steps to protect data in the event of a breach.</p>
