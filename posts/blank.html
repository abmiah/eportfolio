                    <p>Hello Amrol,</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a very interesting post and I have enjoyed your time loop use of providing a historical outlook on industry revolutions and where we are today, highlighting how far we have come. From steam power and manual labor, to artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced data analytics and IoT.</p>
                    
                    <p>In todayâ€™s world, technology plays a crucial role in the smooth and continuous flow of information and communication, which is essential for the success of any business. The evolution and constant improvement of technology have brought about the industry 4.0 revolution, which has transformed various sectors, including technology, industries, and infrastructure. This has also brought in new risk types and how we address them.</p>
                    
                    <p>Kovaite and Stankeviciene (2019) have identified 5 categories of risk, Technical, Competence, Behavioral, Data Security and Financial. Your use of examples highlights these perfectly. It also reminded me of the Knight Capital Group $440 million Software error. Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading, gaining the reputation of being one of the largest traders in US equities. It took 17 years of dedicated work to build Knight Capital Group into one of the leading trading houses on Wall Street. And it all nearly ended in less than one hour. At Knight, some new trading software contained a flaw that became apparent only after the software was activated when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opened that day. The errant software sent Knight on a buying spree, snapping up 150 different stocks at a total cost of around $7 billion, all in the first hour of trading. Knight attempted to cancel some of the purchases, however some stood confirmed, resulting in the massive blow to the company. (Alqudhaibi, Albarrak, Aloseel, Jagtap & Salonitis, 2023) This highlights another important example of technical risk.</p>
